Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.14,ENG,,0,0,0,,You may have heard of an event horizon,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.14,CHN,,0,0,0,,你也许听说过黑洞的“事件视界”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.14,0:00:06.28,ENG,,0,0,0,,the boundary beyond which not even light can escape a black hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.14,0:00:06.28,CHN,,0,0,0,,在这个视界内即使光也不能逃脱
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.28,0:00:08.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,This is a very interesting surface to think about,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.28,0:00:08.56,CHN,,0,0,0,,这是一个相当有趣的界面
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.56,0:00:12.96,ENG,,0,0,0,,but i want to talk to you about the other boundary around a black hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.56,0:00:12.96,CHN,,0,0,0,,但是今天我要向你介绍黑洞中的另一个界面
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.96,0:00:15.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,It's known as a stationary limit surface.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.96,0:00:15.20,CHN,,0,0,0,,我们称之为“静界”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.20,0:00:17.25,ENG,,0,0,0,,In order for this boundary to be noticeable
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.20,0:00:17.25,CHN,,0,0,0,,为了让这个界面比较明显
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.25,0:00:19.36,ENG,,0,0,0,,our black hole has to be spinning.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.25,0:00:19.36,CHN,,0,0,0,,我们的黑洞需要有一定的自旋
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.36,0:00:23.58,ENG,,0,0,0,,So let's imagine that we're looking at it from above or from one of the poles.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.36,0:00:23.58,CHN,,0,0,0,,想象我们从上方或者转轴方向看去
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.58,0:00:26.00,ENG,,0,0,0,,The spinning of the black hole actually ends up
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.00,0:00:28.66,ENG,,0,0,0,,dragging the space time surrounding it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.58,0:00:28.66,CHN,,0,0,0,,黑洞的自旋将会拖曳周围的时空
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.66,0:00:31.68,ENG,,0,0,0,,If any object, even a photon of light,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.66,0:00:31.68,CHN,,0,0,0,,任何物体 即使是光子
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.68,0:00:34.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,enters this region known as the ergosphere,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.68,0:00:34.48,CHN,,0,0,0,,只要进入到这片名曰“能层”的区域
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.48,0:00:37.83,ENG,,0,0,0,,the region between the event horizon and the stationary limit surface,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.48,0:00:37.83,CHN,,0,0,0,,即事件视界和静界之间的区域
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.83,0:00:39.84,ENG,,0,0,0,,then for somebody looking from far away
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.83,0:00:39.84,CHN,,0,0,0,,在远处的某人看来
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.84,0:00:44.39,ENG,,0,0,0,,the object will always appear to rotate in the same direction as the black hole,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.84,0:00:44.39,CHN,,0,0,0,,这个物体总是顺着黑洞的自旋方向来旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.39,0:00:47.84,ENG,,0,0,0,,even if it was going the other way before entering the ergosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.39,0:00:47.84,CHN,,0,0,0,,即使它是从相反的方向进入能层的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.84,0:00:51.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,That's because the space time in which this object exists
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.84,0:00:51.16,CHN,,0,0,0,,这是因为这个物体所处的时空
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.16,0:00:54.78,ENG,,0,0,0,,is literally being dragged around with the rotation of the black hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.16,0:00:54.78,CHN,,0,0,0,,被黑洞的旋转“拉扯”得扭曲了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.78,0:00:59.60,ENG,,0,0,0,,That's why this effect is known as frame dragging.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.78,0:00:59.60,CHN,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么这个效应被称作“参考系拖拽”
