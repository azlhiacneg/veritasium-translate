00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Finding scorpions in the desert at night
夜间在沙漠中寻找蝎子

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,040
is surprisingly easy.
出乎意料得容易

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,670
All you need is an ultraviolet torch
你只需要一个紫外线手电筒

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,190
because scorpions are
incredibly fluorescent.
因为蝎子具有令人难以置信的荧光性

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,260
Fluorescence means their
bodies absorb ultraviolet light
荧光意味着它们的身体吸收紫外线

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,000
and reradiate it in the
visible part of the spectrum.
并将其重新辐射到光谱的可见部分

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,210
They glow this bright neon green color.
他们散发这种明亮的霓虹绿色光

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,290
But scorpions aren't the
only animals that fluoresce.
但是蝎子不是唯一一种散发荧光的动物

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,940
Jellyfish, amphibians,
owls, and even platypus'
水母、两栖动物、猫头鹰甚至是鸭嘴兽

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,390
glow under ultraviolet light.
都在紫外线下发光

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,950

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,143
More about them at the end of the show.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm out here in the desert
near Bakersfield, California,
我现在在加州贝克斯菲尔德附近的沙漠中

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
looking for scorpions with Carl Kloock,
和 Carl Kloock 一起找寻蝎子

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,080
a professor of biology
at Cal State Bakersfield.
他是加州州立大学贝克斯菲尔德分校的生物学教授

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,180
He's been researching
scorpion fluorescence
他研究蝎子的荧光性

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,010
for over a decade.
已经超过十年

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,710
- If you have a black light
it's really pretty easy.
- 如果你有黑光灯的话，这真的十分容易

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,450
If they're there, you're
going to spot them.
如果蝎子在那，你就能看见它们

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,360
- [Derek] Does he look
like he's in a posture
- 它是否看起来像在摆姿势

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,210
to like defend himself?
保护自己？

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,660
- [Carl] Yeah, he's not real happy.
- 是的，它不太高兴

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,600
- [Derek] Okay.
- 好的

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,470
(man chuckling)

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,440
- [Carl] I'm going to grab my high-tech
- 在此我要拿出

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,530
scorpion catching equipment here.
我的高科技捕蝎装置

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,810
It's a tongue depressor with
a yellow highlighter on it.
是一个涂有黄色荧光的压舌板

28
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,420
So it fluoresces in black light.
So you can see where it is.
它在黑光灯下会散发荧光
因此你能看见它在哪

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,315
- [Derek] Got it.
- 明白了

30
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,720
(man chuckling)

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,170
- [Carl] This technique is usually to put
- 这种技术通常

32
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,307
the vial behind him,
将瓶子放在蝎子身后

33
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:13,854
then in front of him.
压舌板放在蝎子身前

34
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,810
- [Derek] That was impressive.
- 这令人印象深刻

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,610
All right. Should we give it a shot?
好的。我们也试一试？

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,420
- [Carl] Just gently pokes him back in.
- 仅仅轻轻地将它戳进去

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,410
And they usually just kind of do a little
他们通常会做一些

38
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,763
side crab walk back.
类似螃蟹的侧行

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,380
There you go, and just tilt it up.
就这样，把它倾斜起来

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,237
- [Derek] Unbelievable.
- 难以置信

41
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:35,070
(man chuckles)

42
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,270
Unbelievable.
难以置信！

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,300
All right. I'm going to get him.
好的，我一定要抓到他

44
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,770
But why are scorpions fluorescent?
但是为什么蝎子有荧光性？

45
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,310
- I've got about 12 hypotheses.
- 我有大约 12 种假说

46
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,360
So you test them one at a time.
一次测试它们中的一种

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,930
- [Derek] You've got
12 Hypotheses about why
- 你有关于蝎子为何散发荧光

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,180
the scorpions fluoresce?
12 种假说？

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,570
- More like six actually,
I was being a little bit...
实际上更像是 6 个
我有点...

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,880
Almost all scorpions fluoresce.
几乎所有的蝎子都有荧光性

51
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,990
I haven't seen it myself,
我自己没有亲眼见过

52
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,400
but some that live at living
caves they don't fluoresce
但是有些居住在洞穴中的蝎子不散发荧光

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,150
but it's only like one very small group.
但它只是蝎子中非常小的一部分

54
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,480
All the other scorpions fluoresce.
其他所有蝎子都散发荧光

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,230
One possibility is just,
this is a Relic Trait.
一种可能性是
这是一种遗留特性

56
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,680
It's something they developed way back
是自他们从这片陆地上诞生

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,160
when they first came out on
land and just haven't lost.
就发展出的特性且一直没有丢失

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,240
A chemical that has another function
一种有着其他功能的化学物质

59
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
that just happens to fluoresce.
正巧会散发荧光

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
There are plenty of
chemicals that fluoresce.
有许多化学物质都会散发荧光

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,400
I mean, we have internal
bodily fluids that fluoresce.
我的意思是，我们体内有会散发荧光的体液

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,320
And clearly those are
never exposed to UV light.
而显然，这些从来没有暴露在紫外线下。

63
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,630
So the idea of having a function
所以专门有一个荧光功能的这种想法

64
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,855
for that fluorescence is kind of silly.
有些愚蠢

65
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,610
This fluoresce is about the
same color as a scorpion,
这个荧光颜色和蝎子的荧光颜色一样

66
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,060
but clearly isn't a scorpion.
但他显然不是个蝎子

67
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,280
It's actually a rock.
它实际上是一块石头

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,733
The color is a little off.
颜色有点偏

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,260
- [Derek] But that is like, what is that?
- 但是它像是。。那是什么？

70
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,390
- It's plastic from Walpole.
它是来自华普的塑料

71
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,250
- [Derek] Huh.
- 呵

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,810
You anted to know if the
scorpions were fluorescing
你想知道是否蝎子

73
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,020
in order to attract insects.
是为了吸引昆虫散发荧光

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,853
- Right.
- 没错

75
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:41,686
- [Narrator] So how did you test that?
- 你是怎么测试的？

76
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:44,400
- What I did was I used preserved
scorpions like these ones
我使用了保存的蝎子，例如这些


77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,510
and I took half of them and dip them in
拿出其中一半，将他们浸入

78
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,370
UV blocking marine varnish
so they didn't fluoresce.
阻隔紫外线的船舶清漆，这样一来他们不会散发荧光

79
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,070
And then I just used basically flypaper
之后我仅仅使用捕蝇纸

80
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,730
and took those things outside
and set them side by side
将他们放在户外并排摆放

81
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,910
and then found the
number of flying insects
观察各个捕蝇纸

82
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,854
that were caught in each.
捕捉到的飞虫数量

83
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:01,687
- [Derek] Okay.
- 好的

84
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,330
- [Carl] So we were outside in moonlight
- 我们在户外的月光下

85
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,870
and I did the same experiment,
在新月和满月时候

86
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,860
both under the new moon and the full moon.
做了同样的实验

87
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,400
And so what I found from that was
我从实验中发现

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,730
when there was a new moon,
新月之时

89
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,000
there was no difference in the number
散发荧光的蝎子与不散发荧光的蝎子

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,590
of insects caught by the fluorescent
捕捉到的昆虫数量

91
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,860
and non-fluorescent scorpions.
没有区别

92
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,400
But under the full moon,
there's nice, bright UV light
但是在满月下，有充足、明亮的紫外光时

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
available there was a difference
两者数量有差别

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,970
and the ones that fluoresce
actually caught fewer insects.
散发荧光的蝎子实际上吸引了更少昆虫

95
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,480
- It seems kind of counterintuitive.
- 这似乎有点违反直觉。

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,910
- So that tells me that
my hypothesis was wrong.
- 这意味着我的假说是错的

97
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,290
Which happens a lot.
这常常发生

98
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,950
Basically yeah, they're not using
大体上说，蝎子并不使用他们的荧光

99
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,550
their fluorescence to lure insects.
来引诱昆虫

100
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,880
In fact, the fluorescence is
a bad thing for them in terms
实际上，就其捕捉飞虫的能力而言

101
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,130
of their ability to catch
flying insects, at least.
荧光对它们来说是一件坏事

102
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,300
- Let me ask you this.
- 我问你一个问题

103
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,240
If you find that fluorescence
is counterproductive
如果你发现荧光在某些方面

104
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
for the scorpion in some way,
对蝎子是无益的

105
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,250
doesn't that indicate that there
这难道不意味着

106
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,210
has to be something useful?
在某些方面是有用的？

107
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,000
- Exactly. There must be
something that counteracts that.
- 确实。一定有什么可以抵消这一点

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,833
- Sort of negative.
- 有点消极

109
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,850
- That negative, yeah.
- 是有点消极

110
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,390
Scorpions are really well
adapted for what they do.
蝎子真的很适应它们的工作

111
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,130
One of the cool things
here is it scorpions
比较酷的一点是

112
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,030
are actually able to
metabolize iron and nickel.
蝎子实际上能够代谢铁和镍。

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,610
And in their pincer here
它们的螯这里

114
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,020
and on the tips of their claws,
以及它们的附肢前端

115
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,323
they actually have basically
iron to strengthen that.
它们用铁来强化这些部位

116
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:10,410
- [Derek] Iron and nickel
at the end of their tail?
- 在他们的尾部末端有铁和镍？

117
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,690
- [Carl] Yeah. Yeah.
- 是的，没错

118
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,980
You can see like the color
here's a little bit different
你可以看出这边的颜色有一点不同

119
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,209
and that's because of the iron.
这是因为铁元素

120
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,139
- [Derek] That seems
very aggressive to me.
在我看来，这只似乎非常具有侵略性。

121
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,820
One of the main things
we're interested in here
我们主要好奇的事情之一是

122
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,940
is how they see.
蝎子是如何看见的

123
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,010
So I've seen two of their eyes.
我看见了他的两只眼睛

124
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,970
- [Carl] So, those are the
median eyes right there.
- 这是它的中眼

125
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,220
- [Derek] Those two dark spots.
- 这两个小黑点

126
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,070
- [Carl] Yeah. There's a cluster
of three eyes right there.
- 没错。这边有 3 个侧眼簇

127
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,210
And of course on the other
side, so they're symmetrical.
另外一边也有，他们是对称的

128
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,940
So they have a total of eight eyes.
所以他们一共有 8 只眼睛

129
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,990
- Can they detect the light
with parts of their body
- 他们能用不是眼睛的身体部位

130
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,400
that are not eyes?
探测光照吗？

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,330
- Yeah. Actually they can.

132
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,170
- [Derek] In a 1968 experiment,

133
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,780
researchers put scorpions in
half covered Petri dishes.

134
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,180
Then they exposed them to bright
light and all the scorpions

135
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,015
quickly hid under the covered
part of the Petri dish.

136
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:55,990
Then the researchers painted
over the eyes of the scorpions.

137
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,490
So they couldn't see and
repeated the experiment.

138
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,940
But when they turned on
the light, 93% of the time,

139
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,630
the blinded scorpions still scuttled over

140
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,260
to the covered side.

141
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,510
The finding was remarkable.

142
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,220
Scorpions don't need their
eyes to detect light.

143
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,420
They can sense it with their bodies.

144
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,640
- That showed that they have what's called

145
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,430
an extra ocular light sense in their tail.

146
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,620
So they can detect light with their tail.

147
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,960
They can't form images, they can't,

148
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,680
but they can detect light.

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
- The tail of a scorpion can detect light?

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,500
- One hypothesis is that they use it

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
to communicate with one another.

152
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,620
The idea being that
they use it to determine

153
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,350
primarily whether or not

154
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,870
another scorpion out there

155
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,240
is of the same species for mating.

156
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,930
One fairly low probability hypothesis

157
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,380
is that they can use it as camouflage

158
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,997
because they absorb UV light.

159
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,800
If they're sitting on another
surface that absorbs UV light

160
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,610
and you have an organism
that sees in the UV light

161
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,960
like some owls and
things like that can do,

162
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,390
they would tend to blend
in very nicely with that.

163
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,140
So it's a possibility,

164
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,070
but not that many organisms see in UV

165
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,810
and not that many that
eat scorpion, see in UV

166
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,453
so it doesn't seem very likely.

167
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,400
- [Derek] You go for it.

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
- [Carl] You want me to do it upclose?

169
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,066
- [Narrator] You do it.

170
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,090
- [Carl] Close.

171
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,800
Here you go. See?

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,910
There you go, wow.

173
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,590
- One of the ideas is
scorpions came out of the water

174
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,160
from Silurian period long time ago.

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
And there was a lot
more UV just in sunlight

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,790
and things like that then,
because we didn't have

177
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,010
an ozone layer, we didn't have, you know,

178
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,190
all these things that are
blocking UV in our atmosphere now.

179
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,740
And so the one of the idea is that

180
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,460
it actually acts as a sunscreen.

181
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,132
It's way to absorb those
damaging ultraviolet photons

182
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,860
and convert them away into something

183
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,140
and basically keep them from
penetrating into the body

184
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,220
and causing damage.

185
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,520
- [Derek] Go in your hole.

186
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,093
There you go.

187
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,973
You got him.

188
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,840
- And then there have been some other ones

189
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,400
that are a little bit more out there.

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,877
One of which being the one that I actually

191
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,120
settled on at the end is that they use it

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,350
as part of their sensory
system to detect the presence

193
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,250
of light in the environment.

194
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,980
So this was the later
experiment after I gave up

195
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,010
on the initial idea that
said that didn't work.

196
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,520
So, all I really did in
that one, very simple,

197
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,110
put a scorpion in each
one of these things here

198
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,060
and then put this under ultraviolet light

199
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,600
and exposed it to ultraviolet light.

200
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,410
And so I measured how
long they spent exposed

201
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,110
versus unexposed and how many times

202
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,690
they went back and forth.

203
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,040
- [Derek] And you were testing scorpions

204
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,100
that were fluorescent and not fluorescent.

205
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,933
- [Carl] Right.

206
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,520
So what I did with that was I developed

207
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,377
a technique to remove, or at least reduce

208
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,550
the ability of scorpions to fluoresce

209
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,440
simply by exposing them for long periods

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,950
of time to ultraviolet light.

211
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,390
So basically, you're just
kind of taking the chemical

212
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,070
that is causing fluorescence
in their exoskeleton

213
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,060
and your photo bleaching.

214
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,304
- [Derek] So you're kind
of breaking it down?

215
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:48,137
- [Carl] So basically,
you're making the chemical

216
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,680
not be able to function properly anymore.

217
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,560
What we found is the activity
levels changed significantly.

218
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,390
So when you exposed to UV light,

219
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,270
the non-fluorescence scorpions acted like

220
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,880
they were in the dark.

221
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,460
There was no difference
between their behavior

222
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,920
and the dark and in UV light.

223
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,580
Whereas when UV light
was present for the ones

224
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,510
that can fluoresce, they
reduced their activity levels.

225
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,450
- [Derek] What's the conclusion from that?

226
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,350
- [Carl] The conclusion from that

227
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,870
is that the fluorescents
itself is acting as a way to,

228
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,240
for them to detect the
presence of ultraviolet light.

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,390
Another researcher by the
name of Douglas Gaffin,

230
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,610
came up with a great phrase for it.

231
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,170
I wish I'd come up with the
phrase, but I gotta give credit.

232
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,840
He calls it, a whole-body photon detector.

233
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,490
So it's part of their sensory system.

234
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,670
What we don't know is why they want

235
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,210
to detect ultraviolet light so badly

236
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,710
that they've turned their whole
body into a photon detector.

237
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,780
The suspicion is that it
has to do with determining

238
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,960
whether or not they
should come out at night.

239
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,140
- [Derek] The idea is when UV light hits

240
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,100
a scorpion's body, it
fluoresces and the tail detects

241
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
this emitted green light
alerting the scorpion

242
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,360
that it is exposed so
it searches for cover.

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,348
- [Carl] Scorpions are good at starving

244
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:56,670
for long periods of time.

245
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,640
They don't need to eat that often.

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,508
And coming out and foraging
is dangerous for them.

247
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,220
And so they don't like to come out

248
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,520
when it's a moonlit night.

249
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,420
Typically the only ones you'll
find out in the full moon

250
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,620
are the ones that are really
hungry, really need food.

251
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,280
If they're well fed, they'll stay down.

252
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
So they're using that
as basically their cue

253
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,720
in the environment and saying, you know,

254
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,980
okay, this is how bright it is.

255
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,800
So that's a cue as to how
likely I'm being preyed upon.

256
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,460
And then here's how hungry I am.

257
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,203
That's a cue how badly I need
to get out and get some food.

258
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,036
- [Derek] Right.

259
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:23,869
- [Dr. Carl] And then the
trade off between those two

260
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,460
is basically should I go out tonight

261
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,840
or should I stay in my hole.

262
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,910
- [Derek] Yeah.

263
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,577
(techno sound)

264
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,950
