1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Finding scorpions in the desert at night

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,040
is surprisingly easy.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,670
All you need is an ultraviolet torch

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,190
because scorpions are
incredibly fluorescent.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,260
Fluorescence means their
bodies absorb ultraviolet light

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,000
and reradiate it in the
visible part of the spectrum.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,210
They glow this bright neon green color.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,290
But scorpions aren't the
only animals that fluoresce.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,940
Jellyfish, amphibians,
owls, and even platypus'

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,390
glow under ultraviolet light.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,950

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,143
More about them at the end of the show.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm out here in the desert
near Bakersfield, California,

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
looking for scorpions with Carl Kloock,

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,080
a professor of biology
at Cal State Bakersfield.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,180
He's been researching
scorpion fluorescence

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,010
for over a decade.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,710
- If you have a black light
it's really pretty easy.

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,450
If they're there, you're
going to spot them.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,360
- [Derek] Does he look
like he's in a posture

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,210
to like defend himself?

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,660
- [Carl] Yeah, he's not real happy.

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,600
- [Derek] Okay.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,470
(man chuckling)

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,440
- [Carl] I'm going to grab my high-tech

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,530
scorpion catching equipment here.

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,810
It's a tongue depressor with
a yellow highlighter on it.

28
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,420
So it fluoresces in black light.
So you can see where it is.

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,315
- [Derek] Got it.

30
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,720
(man chuckling)

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,170
- [Carl] This technique is usually to put

32
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,307
the vial behind him,

33
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:13,854
then in front of him.

34
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,810
- [Derek] That was impressive.

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,610
All right. Should we give it a shot?

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,420
- [Carl] Just gently pokes him back in.

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,410
And they usually just kind of do a little

38
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,763
side crab walk back.

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,380
There you go, and just tilt it up.

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,237
- [Derek] Unbelievable.

41
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:35,070
(man chuckles)

42
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,270
Unbelievable.

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,300
All right. I'm going to get him.

44
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,770
But why are scorpions fluorescent?

45
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,310
- I've got about 12 hypotheses.

46
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,360
So you test them one at a time.

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,930
- [Derek] You've got
12 Hypotheses about why

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,180
the scorpions fluoresce?

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,570
- More like six actually,
I was being a little bit...

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,880
Almost all scorpions fluoresce.

51
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,990
I haven't seen it myself,

52
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,400
but some that live at living
caves they don't fluoresce

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,150
but it's only like one very small group.

54
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,480
All the other scorpions fluoresce.

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,230
One possibility is just,
this is a Relic Trait.

56
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,680
It's something they developed way back

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,160
when they first came out on
land and just haven't lost.

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,240
A chemical that has another function

59
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
that just happens to fluoresce.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
There are plenty of
chemicals that fluoresce.

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,400
I mean, we have internal
bodily fluids that fluoresce.

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,320
And clearly those are
never exposed to UV light.

63
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,630
So the idea of having a function

64
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,855
for that fluorescence is kind of silly.

65
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,610
This fluoresce is about the
same color as a scorpion,

66
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,060
but clearly isn't a scorpion.

67
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,280
It's actually a rock.

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,733
The color is a little off.

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,260
- [Derek] But that is like, what is that?

70
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,390
- It's plastic from Walpole.

71
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,250
- [Derek] Huh.

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,810
You anted to know if the
scorpions were fluorescing

73
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,020
in order to attract insects.

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,853
- Right.

75
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:41,686
- [Narrator] So how did you test that?

76
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:44,400
- What I did was I used preserved
scorpions like these ones

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,510
and I took half of them and dip them in

78
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,370
UV blocking marine varnish
so they didn't fluoresce.

79
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,070
And then I just used basically flypaper

80
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,730
and took those things outside
and set them side by side

81
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,910
and then found the
number of flying insects

82
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,854
that were caught in each.

83
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:01,687
- [Derek] Okay.

84
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,330
- [Carl] So we were outside in moonlight

85
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,870
and I did the same experiment,

86
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,860
both under the new moon and the full moon.

87
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,400
And so what I found from that was

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,730
when there was a new moon,

89
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,000
there was no difference in the number

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,590
of insects caught by the fluorescent

91
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,860
and non-fluorescent scorpions.

92
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,400
But under the full moon,
there's nice, bright UV light

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
available there was a difference

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,970
and the ones that fluoresce
actually caught fewer insects.

95
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,480
- It seems kind of counterintuitive.

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,910
- So that tells me that
my hypothesis was wrong.

97
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,290
Which happens a lot.

98
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,950
Basically yeah, they're not using

99
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,550
their fluorescence to lure insects.

100
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,880
In fact, the fluorescence is
a bad thing for them in terms

101
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,130
of their ability to catch
flying insects, at least.

102
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,300
- Let me ask you this.

103
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,240
If you find that fluorescence
is counterproductive

104
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
for the scorpion in some way,

105
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,250
doesn't that indicate that there

106
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,210
has to be something useful?

107
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,000
- Exactly. There must be
something that counteracts that.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,833
- Sort of negative.

109
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,850
- That negative, yeah.

110
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,390
Scorpions are really well
adapted for what they do.

111
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,130
One of the cool things
here is it scorpions

112
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,030
are actually able to
metabolize iron and nickel.

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,610
And in their pincer here

114
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,020
and on the tips of their claws,

115
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,323
they actually have basically
iron to strengthen that.

116
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:10,410
- [Derek] Iron and nickel
at the end of their tail?

117
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,690
- [Carl] Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,980
You can see like the color
here's a little bit different

119
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,209
and that's because of the iron.

120
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,139
- [Derek] That seems
very aggressive to me.

121
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,820
One of the main things
we're interested in here

122
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,940
is how they see.

123
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,010
So I've seen two of their eyes.

124
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,970
- [Carl] So, those are the
median eyes right there.

125
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,220
- [Derek] Those two dark spots.

126
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,070
- [Carl] Yeah. There's a cluster
of three eyes right there.

127
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,210
And of course on the other
side, so they're symmetrical.

128
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,940
So they have a total of eight eyes.

129
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,990
- Can they detect the light with parts of their body
它们可以用身体的一部分感受到光吗

130
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,400
that are not eyes?
如果不用眼睛的话

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,330
- Yeah. Actually they can.
是的，它们确实可以

132
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,170
- [Derek] In a 1968 experiment,
1968年，有人做了一个实验

133
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,780
researchers put scorpions in
half covered Petri dishes.
研究者们把蝎子放进遮住了一半的培养皿里面

134
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,180
Then they exposed them to bright
light and all the scorpions
然后将它们置于明亮光照下

135
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,015
quickly hid under the covered
part of the Petri dish.
所有的蝎子都迅速躲进了遮光的那一半区域

136
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:55,990
Then the researchers painted
over the eyes of the scorpions.
随后，他们又给蝎子的眼睛刷上油漆

137
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,490
So they couldn't see and
repeated the experiment.
这剥夺了蝎子的视力，接着他们重复了刚才的实验

138
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,940
But when they turned on
the light, 93% of the time,
但当他们开灯后，有93%的时间

139
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,630
the blinded scorpions still scuttled over
这些瞎掉的蝎子依然逃到

140
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,260
to the covered side.
没有光照的那一半

141
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,510
The finding was remarkable.
这个发现相当惊人

142
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,220
Scorpions don't need their eyes to detect light.
蝎子不需要用眼睛来探测光亮

143
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,420
They can sense it with their bodies.
它们用身体就能做到

144
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,640
- That showed that they have what's called
这表明，它们尾部有一种所谓的

145
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,430
an extra ocular light sense in their tail.
额外的光感器

146
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,620
So they can detect light with their tail.
所以它们可以用尾巴探测到光

147
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,960
They can't form images, they can't,
它们不能这样产生视觉
确实

148
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,680
but they can detect light.
但可以用来探测光

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
- The tail of a scorpion can detect light?
蝎子的尾巴可以用来探测光线？

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,500
- One hypothesis is that they use it
有一种猜测是，它们通过这种荧光

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
to communicate with one another.
来互相交流

152
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,620
The idea being that
they use it to determine
它们用荧光来

153
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,350
primarily whether or not
初步判断

154
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,870
another scorpion out there
其他的蝎子是否

155
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,240
is of the same species for mating.
和自己是同一个物种，可以交配

156
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,930
One fairly low probability hypothesis
还有种猜测，可能性相对低一些

157
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,380
is that they can use it as camouflage
它们把荧光当成迷彩

158
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,997
because they absorb UV light.
因为它们可以吸收紫外线

159
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,800
If they're sitting on another
surface that absorbs UV light
如果它们身处同样会吸收紫外线的物体表面

160
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,610
and you have an organism
that sees in the UV light
对于一些可以看到紫外线的动物

161
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,960
like some owls and
things like that can do,
比如猫头鹰之类的

162
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,390
they would tend to blend
in very nicely with that.
在它们眼中，蝎子很容易和环境混在一起

163
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,140
So it's a possibility,
所以这也是一种可能

164
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,070
but not that many organisms see in UV
但是没有那么多能看到紫外光的物种

165
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,810
and not that many that
eat scorpion, see in UV
而捕食蝎子的物种也鲜有能看到紫外光的

166
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,453
so it doesn't seem very likely.
所以这个假说似乎不大可能成立

167
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,400
- [Derek] You go for it.
你来抓这只蝎子

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
- [Carl] You want me to do it upclose?
要我靠上去吗？

169
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,066
- [Narrator] You do it.
行

170
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,090
- [Carl] Close.
快抓到了

171
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,800
Here you go. See?
搞定
能看到吗

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,910
There you go, wow.
就是这个 哇

173
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,590
- One of the ideas is
scorpions came out of the water
有种观点认为，蝎子离开水

174
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,160
from Silurian period long time ago.
是在志留纪时期，那是很久以前

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
And there was a lot
more UV just in sunlight
当时，太阳光里的紫外线强度比现在高得多

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,790
and things like that then,
because we didn't have
还有其它类似的辐射
因为那时候的地球并没有

177
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,010
an ozone layer, we didn't have, you know,
臭氧层，你知道的，那时候真没有

178
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,190
all these things that are
blocking UV in our atmosphere now.
现在的我们，全靠大气中的臭氧层阻挡紫外光

179
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,740
And so the one of the idea is that
于是就有了又一个假说

180
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,460
it actually acts as a sunscreen.
这种荧光实际上是防晒层

181
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,132
It's way to absorb those
damaging ultraviolet photons
是一种吸收有害紫外光的方式

182
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,860
and convert them away into something
同时将它们转化为其它能量

183
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,140
and basically keep them from
penetrating into the body
避免它们直接穿透身体

184
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,220
and causing damage.
并导致损伤

185
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,520
- [Derek] Go in your hole.
进去吧你

186
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,093
There you go.
抓到了

187
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,973
You got him.
抓到啦

188
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,840
- And then there have been some other ones
当然还有一些其他的猜想

189
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,400
that are a little bit more out there.
这些猜想有一点点奇怪

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,877
One of which being the one that I actually
其中一个，也是我

191
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,120
settled on at the end is that they use it
拿来压轴的这一个，就是，蝎子把荧光

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,350
as part of their sensory
system to detect the presence
当成感觉系统的一部分，用来探测

193
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,250
of light in the environment.
环境中光线的存在

194
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,980
So this was the later
experiment after I gave up
这个实验做得迟，是在我放弃最初的想法以后

195
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,010
on the initial idea that
said that didn't work.
那个想法否定了这一种可能

196
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,520
So, all I really did in
that one, very simple,
实验的操作非常简单

197
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,110
put a scorpion in each
one of these things here
把蝎子关进这种培养皿

198
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,060
and then put this under ultraviolet light
然后放在紫外灯下

199
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,600
and exposed it to ultraviolet light.
让它被紫外线照射

200
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,410
And so I measured how
long they spent exposed
我比较了它们暴露在外

201
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,110
versus unexposed and how many times
和躲起来的时间，同时还记录了

202
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,690
they went back and forth.
它们来回的次数

203
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,040
- [Derek] And you were testing scorpions
所以你在测试

204
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,100
that were fluorescent and not fluorescent.
有荧光的和没有荧光的蝎子

205
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,933
- [Carl] Right.
是的

206
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,520
So what I did with that was I developed
为了处理这些蝎子，我开发了一个技术

207
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,377
a technique to remove, or at least reduce
用来解除，或者至少减弱

208
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,550
the ability of scorpions to fluoresce
蝎子产生荧光的能力

209
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,440
simply by exposing them for long periods
只要将它们长时间

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,950
of time to ultraviolet light.
置于紫外光下

211
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,390
So basically, you're just
kind of taking the chemical
主要是为了在一定程度上去除

212
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,070
that is causing fluorescence
in their exoskeleton
蝎子外骨骼表面的荧光物质

213
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,060
and your photo bleaching.
照片也就不会因为荧光而褪色

214
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,304
- [Derek] So you're kind
of breaking it down?
所以你是希望荧光物质被分解？

215
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:48,137
- [Carl] So basically,
you're making the chemical
基本上就是要让这化学物质

216
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,680
not be able to function properly anymore.
不能够再发挥作用

217
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,560
What we found is the activity
levels changed significantly.
我们发现，蝎子的活跃程度有显著变化

218
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,390
So when you exposed to UV light,
当蝎子们受紫外线照射时

219
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,270
the non-fluorescence scorpions acted like
没有荧光的蝎子依然像

220
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,880
they were in the dark.
在黑暗中一样活动

221
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,460
There was no difference
between their behavior
它们的行为并无差异

222
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,920
and the dark and in UV light.
无论是处于黑暗还是紫外光下

223
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,580
Whereas when UV light
was present for the ones
然而，将荧光蝎子置于紫外灯下时

224
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,510
that can fluoresce, they
reduced their activity levels.
它们的活跃程度降低了

225
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,450
- [Derek] What's the conclusion from that?
从中能得到什么结论呢

226
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,350
- [Carl] The conclusion from that
结论就是

227
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,870
is that the fluorescents
itself is acting as a way to,
荧光本身作为一种方式

228
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,240
for them to detect the
presence of ultraviolet light.
被蝎子们用来探测紫外线

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,390
Another researcher by the
name of Douglas Gaffin,
另一个名叫 Douglas Gaffin 的研究者

230
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,610
came up with a great phrase for it.
给出了一个很合适的名字

231
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,170
I wish I'd come up with the
phrase, but I gotta give credit.
我真希望这是我想出来的，但我得承认这件事

232
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,840
He calls it, a whole-body photon detector.
他将其称为“全身光线探测器”

233
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,490
So it's part of their sensory system.
它是蝎子的感觉系统的一部分

234
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,670
What we don't know is why they want
我们还不知道，它们为什么如此渴望

235
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,210
to detect ultraviolet light so badly
探测到紫外光

236
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,710
that they've turned their whole
body into a photon detector.
以至于它们把整个身体都变成了光线探测器

237
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,780
The suspicion is that it
has to do with determining
我们怀疑这可能和

238
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,960
whether or not they
should come out at night.
是否要在夜间行动的决断有关

239
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,140
- [Derek] The idea is when UV light hits
按照这个想法，当紫外光照射到

240
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,100
a scorpion's body, it
fluoresces and the tail detects
蝎子的身体时，它就发出荧光，尾巴也会探测到

241
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
this emitted green light
alerting the scorpion
自身发出的绿光

242
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,360
that it is exposed so
it searches for cover.
警告它暴露了位置，要寻找藏身处

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,348
- [Carl] Scorpions are good at starving
蝎子很擅长挨饿

244
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:56,670
for long periods of time.
它们能撑很久

245
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,640
They don't need to eat that often.
不需要那么经常地进食

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,508
And coming out and foraging
is dangerous for them.
出来觅食对它们是很危险滴

247
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,220
And so they don't like to come out
所以它们也不喜欢

248
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,520
when it's a moonlit night.
在有月亮的夜间出来

249
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,420
Typically the only ones you'll
find out in the full moon
通常而言，你在月圆之夜能找到的仅有的蝎子

250
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,620
are the ones that are really
hungry, really need food.
是那些真的很饿，很需要食物的蝎子

251
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,280
If they're well fed, they'll stay down.
如果吃得很饱，它们会继续窝在地下

252
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
So they're using that
as basically their cue
总的来说，它们就用荧光作为环境信号

253
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,720
in the environment and saying, you know
这种信号表示 

254
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,980
okay, this is how bright it is.
恩，外面似乎有点亮

255
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,800
So that's a cue as to how
likely I'm being preyed upon.
恐怕我已经被盯上了

256
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,460
And then here's how hungry I am.
可是现在又很饿

257
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,203
That's a cue how badly I need
to get out and get some food.
这又是一个信号，表明我有多么需要外出觅食

258
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,036
- [Derek] Right.
对

259
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:23,869
- [Dr. Carl] And then the
trade off between those two
而这两者的权衡

260
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,460
is basically should I go out tonight
大概就是，今晚是该出去

261
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,840
or should I stay in my hole.
还是留在洞里

262
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,910
- [Derek] Yeah.
是的

263
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,577
(techno sound)

264
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,950
- If you like overpaying
when you shop well,

265
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,600
then don't listen to this next part.

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,720
But if you want to save
money, then keep watching.

267
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,440
Because this portion of
the video is sponsored
