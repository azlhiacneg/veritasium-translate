Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.13,0:02:11.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我的意思是，我们体内有会散发荧光的体液
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.50,0:02:13.50,English,,0,0,0,,And clearly those are never exposed to UV light.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.50,0:02:13.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而显然，这些从来没有暴露在紫外线下
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.50,0:02:16.78,English,,0,0,0,,So the idea of having a function for that fluorescence is kind of silly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.50,0:02:16.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以专门有一个荧光功能的这种想法有些愚蠢
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.78,0:02:18.81,English,,0,0,0,,This fluoresce is about the same color as a scorpion,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.78,0:02:18.81,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个荧光颜色和蝎子的荧光颜色一样
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.81,0:02:20.29,English,,0,0,0,,but clearly isn't a scorpion.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.38,0:02:34.18,English,,0,0,0,,You wanted to know if the scorpions were fluorescing in order to attract insects.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.38,0:02:34.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你想知道蝎子发出荧光是不是为了吸引昆虫
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.18,0:02:34.51,English,,0,0,0,,- Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.18,0:02:34.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 没错
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.51,0:02:35.86,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] So how did you test that?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.51,0:02:35.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 你是怎么测试这个假说的？
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.86,0:02:38.56,English,,0,0,0,,- What I did was I used preserved scorpions like these ones
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.86,0:02:38.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我使用了抓到的蝎子，例如这些
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.18,English,,0,0,0,,and I took half of them and dip them in UV blocking marine varnish
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我将蝎子等分成两组，将一组浸入阻隔紫外线的船舶清漆
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.18,0:02:44.50,English,,0,0,0,,so they didn't fluoresce.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.18,0:02:44.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这样一来他们不会散发荧光
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.50,0:02:47.25,English,,0,0,0,,And then I just used basically flypaper
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.50,0:02:47.25,Chinese,,0,0,0,,之后我就使用捕蝇纸之类的东西，
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.25,0:02:49.92,English,,0,0,0,,and took those things outside and set them side by side
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.25,0:02:49.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,将他们放在户外并排摆放
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.92,0:02:53.00,English,,0,0,0,,and then found the number of flying insects
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.92,0:02:53.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,观察各个捕蝇纸
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.00,0:02:54.89,English,,0,0,0,,that were caught in each.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.89,0:02:55.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 好的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.16,0:02:56.59,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] So we were outside in moonlight
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.16,0:02:56.59,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 我们在野外的月光下
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.39,0:03:00.95,English,,0,0,0,,and I did the same experiment, both under the new moon and the full moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.39,0:03:00.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,同样的实验在新月时和满月时都做了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.95,0:03:03.91,English,,0,0,0,,And so what I found from that was when there was a new moon,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.95,0:03:03.91,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我从实验中发现新月之时
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.91,0:03:07.95,English,,0,0,0,,there was no difference in the number of insects caught by the fluorescent and non-fluorescent scorpions.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.91,0:03:07.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,散发荧光的蝎子与不散发荧光的蝎子捕捉到的昆虫数量没有区别
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.95,0:03:12.03,English,,0,0,0,,But under the full moon, there's nice, bright UV light available there was a difference
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.95,0:03:12.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是在满月下，有充足、明亮的紫外光时，捕捉到的昆虫数量有差别
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.03,0:03:14.68,English,,0,0,0,,and the ones that fluoresce actually caught fewer insects.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.03,0:03:14.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,散发荧光的蝎子所吸引的昆虫反而更少
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.09,0:03:16.54,English,,0,0,0,,- It seems kind of counterintuitive.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.09,0:03:16.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 这似乎有点违反直觉
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.54,0:03:19.01,English,,0,0,0,,- So that tells me that my hypothesis was wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.54,0:03:19.01,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 这意味着我的假说是错的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.01,0:03:20.18,English,,0,0,0,,Which happens a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.01,0:03:20.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这常常发生

Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.19,0:03:38.15,English,,0,0,0,,doesn't that indicate that there has to be something useful?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.19,0:03:38.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这难道不意味着在某些方面是有用的？
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.15,0:03:41.20,English,,0,0,0,,- Exactly. There must be something that counteracts that.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.44,0:04:28.07,English,,0,0,0,,So they have a total of eight eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.44,0:04:28.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以蝎子一共有 8 只眼睛
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.07,0:04:32.29,English,,0,0,0,,- Can they detect the light with parts of their body that are not eyes?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.07,0:04:32.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 他们能用除眼睛之外的身体部位探测光照吗？

Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.61,0:04:34.29,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是的，它们确实可以

Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.37,0:04:46.07,English,,0,0,0,,and all the scorpions quickly hid under the covered part of the Petri dish.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.37,0:04:46.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所有的蝎子都迅速躲进了遮光的那一半区域
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.57,0:04:50.18,English,,0,0,0,,Then the researchers painted over the eyes of the scorpions.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.57,0:04:50.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,随后，他们又给蝎子的眼睛刷上油漆
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.18,0:04:53.03,English,,0,0,0,,So they couldn't see and repeated the experiment.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.18,0:04:53.03,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这剥夺了蝎子的视力，接着他们重复了刚才的实验
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.65,0:04:55.09,English,,0,0,0,,But when they turned on the light,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.65,0:04:55.09,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但当他们开灯后，

Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.49,0:04:57.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有93%的概率
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.12,0:05:00.90,English,,0,0,0,,the blinded scorpions still scuttled over to the covered side.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.12,0:05:00.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这些瞎掉的蝎子依然逃到没有光照的那一半
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.39,0:05:03.62,English,,0,0,0,,The finding was remarkable.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.39,0:05:03.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个发现相当惊人
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.62,0:05:06.34,English,,0,0,0,,Scorpions don't need their eyes to detect light.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.62,0:05:06.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,蝎子不需要用眼睛来探测光亮
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.34,0:05:08.54,English,,0,0,0,,They can sense it with their bodies.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.34,0:05:08.54,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它们用身体就能做到
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.54,0:05:12.07,English,,0,0,0,,- That showed that they have what's called an extra ocular light sense in their tail.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.54,0:05:12.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这表明，它们尾部有一种所谓的额外的光感器
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.61,0:05:14.19,English,,0,0,0,,So they can detect light with their tail.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.61,0:05:14.19,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以它们可以用尾巴探测到光
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.70,0:05:17.14,English,,0,0,0,,They can't form images, they can't, but they can detect light.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.70,0:05:17.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它们不能这样产生视觉，确实，但可以用来探测光
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.76,0:05:19.95,English,,0,0,0,,- The tail of a scorpion can detect light?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.76,0:05:19.95,Chinese,,0,0,0,,蝎子的尾巴可以用来探测光线？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.87,0:05:24.11,English,,0,0,0,,- One hypothesis is that they use it to communicate with one another.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.87,0:05:24.11,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有一种猜测是，它们通过这种荧光来互相交流
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.61,0:05:27.79,English,,0,0,0,,Um, the idea being that they use it to determine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.61,0:05:27.79,Chinese,,0,0,0,,想法是，它们用荧光来
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.79,0:05:29.51,English,,0,0,0,,primarily whether or not
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.79,0:05:29.51,Chinese,,0,0,0,,初步判断

Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.51,0:05:32.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,其他蝎子是否为可以交配的同一物种
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.42,0:05:37.67,English,,0,0,0,,One fairly low probability hypothesis is that they can use it as camouflage
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.42,0:05:37.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,还有种猜测，可能性相对低一些它们把荧光当成迷彩
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.53,0:05:40.50,English,,0,0,0,,because they absorb UV light.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.53,0:05:40.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为它们可以吸收紫外线
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.63,0:05:44.00,English,,0,0,0,,If they're sitting on another surface that absorbs UV light
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.63,0:05:44.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果它们身处同样会吸收紫外线的物体表面
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.00,0:05:46.00,English,,0,0,0,,and you have an organism that sees in the UV light

Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.85,0:05:50.39,English,,0,0,0,,they would tend to blend in very nicely with that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.85,0:05:50.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在它们眼中，蝎子很容易和环境混在一起
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.39,0:05:52.37,English,,0,0,0,,So it's a possibility,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.39,0:05:52.37,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这也是一种可能
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.37,0:05:55.22,English,,0,0,0,,but not that many organisms see in UV
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.37,0:05:55.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是没有那么多能看到紫外光的物种
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.22,0:05:58.01,English,,0,0,0,,and not that many that eat scorpions, see in UV

Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.01,0:05:59.53,English,,0,0,0,,so it doesn't seem very likely.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.01,0:05:59.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这个假说似乎不大可能成立

Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.06,0:06:13.59,English,,0,0,0,,- One of the ideas is scorpions came out of the water
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.06,0:06:13.59,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有种观点认为，蝎子离开水
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.61,0:06:16.33,English,,0,0,0,,hmm, Silurian period? Long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.61,0:06:16.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是在。。志留纪时期吧，怎么说都是很久以前

Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.35,0:06:24.39,English,,0,0,0,,because we didn't have an ozone layer, we didn't have, you know, all these things that are blocking UV in our atmosphere now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.35,0:06:24.39,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为那时候的地球并没有臭氧层，或是现在我们所有的阻挡紫外光的大气气体
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.39,0:06:27.45,English,,0,0,0,,And so the one of the idea is that it actually acts as a sunscreen.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.39,0:06:27.45,Chinese,,0,0,0,,于是就有了又一个假说这种荧光实际上像是防晒霜
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.45,0:06:32.75,English,,0,0,0,,It's way to absorb those damaging ultraviolet photons
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.45,0:06:32.75,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是一种吸收有害紫外光的方式

Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.60,0:06:56.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,就是，蝎子把荧光当成感觉系统的一部分，用来探测环境中光线的存在
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.88,0:06:58.28,English,,0,0,0,,So this was the later experiment
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.88,0:06:58.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个实验做得迟，
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.28,0:07:01.35,English,,0,0,0,,after I gave up on the initial idea that said that didn't work.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.85,0:07:22.26,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] And you were testing scorpions that were fluorescent and not fluorescent.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.85,0:07:22.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以你在测试有荧光的和没有荧光的蝎子
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.26,0:07:25.47,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] Right. So what I did with that was I developed a technique
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.26,0:07:25.47,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是的。为了处理这些蝎子，我开发了一个技术
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.47,0:07:29.86,English,,0,0,0,,to remove, or at least reduce the ability of scorpions to fluoresce
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.47,0:07:29.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,用来解除，或者至少减弱蝎子产生荧光的能力
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.86,0:07:33.17,English,,0,0,0,,simply by exposing them for long periods of time to ultraviolet light.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.86,0:07:33.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,只要将它们长时间置于紫外光下
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.17,0:07:38.12,English,,0,0,0,,So basically, you're just kind of taking the chemical that is causing fluorescence in their exoskeleton
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.17,0:07:38.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,主要是为了在一定程度上去除蝎子外骨骼表面的荧光物质
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.12,0:07:40.12,English,,0,0,0,,and you’re photobleaching.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.12,0:07:40.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,也就是说在光漂白
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.12,0:07:41.32,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] So you're kind of breaking it down?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.12,0:07:41.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以你是希望荧光物质被分解？
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.32,0:07:43.72,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] So basically, you're making the chemical not be able to function properly anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.32,0:07:43.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,基本上就是要让这化学物质不能够再发挥作用
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.72,0:07:47.74,English,,0,0,0,,What we found is the activity levels changed significantly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.72,0:07:47.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们发现，蝎子的活跃程度有显著变化
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.74,0:07:49.57,English,,0,0,0,,So when you exposed to UV light,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.74,0:07:49.57,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当蝎子们受紫外线照射时
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.57,0:07:52.13,English,,0,0,0,,the non-fluorescence scorpions acted like they were in the dark.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.57,0:07:52.13,Chinese,,0,0,0,,没有荧光的蝎子依然像在黑暗中一样活动
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.97,0:07:56.06,English,,0,0,0,,There was no difference between their behavior in the dark and in UV light.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.97,0:07:56.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它们处于黑暗还是紫外光下的行为并无差异
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.06,0:08:00.40,English,,0,0,0,,Whereas when UV light was present for the ones that can fluoresce, they reduced their activity levels.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.06,0:08:00.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然而，将荧光蝎子置于紫外灯下时它们的活跃程度降低了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.40,0:08:02.27,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] What's the conclusion from that?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.40,0:08:02.27,Chinese,,0,0,0,,从中能得到什么结论呢
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.27,0:08:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] The conclusion from that is that the fluorescence itself is acting as a way to,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.27,0:08:06.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,结论就是荧光本身作为一种方式
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.86,0:08:10.26,English,,0,0,0,,for them to detect the presence of ultraviolet light.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.86,0:08:10.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,被蝎子们用来探测紫外线
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.26,0:08:14.35,English,,0,0,0,,Another researcher by the name of Douglas Gaffin,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.26,0:08:14.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,另一个名叫 Douglas Gaffin 的研究者
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.35,0:08:15.80,English,,0,0,0,,came up with a great phrase for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.35,0:08:15.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,给出了一个很合适的名字
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.80,0:08:18.06,English,,0,0,0,,I wish I'd come up with the phrase, but I gotta give credit.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.80,0:08:18.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我真希望这是我想出来的，但我得给他这个信誉
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.06,0:08:20.99,English - With background,,0,0,0,,He calls it, a whole-body photon detector.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.06,0:08:20.99,Chinese - with background,,0,0,0,,他将其称为“全身光线探测器”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.99,0:08:22.63,English,,0,0,0,,So it's part of their sensory system.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.99,0:08:22.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它是蝎子的感觉系统的一部分
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.65,0:08:27.40,English,,0,0,0,,What we don't know is why they want to detect ultraviolet light so badly
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.65,0:08:27.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们还不知道，它们为什么如此渴望探测到紫外光
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.40,0:08:29.83,English,,0,0,0,,that they've turned their whole body into a photon detector.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.40,0:08:29.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,以至于它们把整个身体都变成了光线探测器
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.83,0:08:35.96,English,,0,0,0,,The suspicion is that it has to do with determining whether or not they should come out at night.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.83,0:08:35.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们怀疑这可能和是否要在夜间行动的决断有关
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.96,0:08:39.44,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] The idea is when UV light hits a scorpion's body,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.96,0:08:39.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,按照这个想法，当紫外光照射到蝎子的身体时，
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.44,0:08:45.28,English,,0,0,0,,it fluoresces and the tail detects this emitted green light alerting the scorpion
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.44,0:08:45.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它就发出荧光，尾巴也会探测到自身发出的绿光
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.28,0:08:48.50,English,,0,0,0,,that it is exposed, so it searches for cover.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.28,0:08:48.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,警告它暴露了位置，要寻找藏身处
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.50,0:08:52.35,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] Scorpions are good at starving for long periods of time. They don't need to eat that often.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.50,0:08:52.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,蝎子很擅长挨饿它们能撑很久不需要那么经常地进食
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.78,0:08:55.28,English,,0,0,0,,And coming out and foraging is dangerous for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.78,0:08:55.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,出来觅食对它们是很危险滴
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.96,0:08:58.67,English,,0,0,0,,And so they don't like to come out when it's a moonlit night.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.96,0:08:58.67,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以它们也不喜欢在有月亮的夜间出来
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.67,0:09:01.89,English,,0,0,0,,Typically the only ones you'll find out in the full moon are the ones that are really hungry
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.67,0:09:01.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,通常而言，你在月圆之夜能找到的仅有的蝎子是那些真的很饿，
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.89,0:09:02.85,English,,0,0,0,,really need food.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.89,0:09:02.85,Chinese,,0,0,0,,很需要食物的蝎子
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.85,0:09:04.49,English,,0,0,0,,If they're well fed, they'll stay down.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.85,0:09:04.49,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果吃得很饱，它们会继续窝在地下
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.49,0:09:07.15,English,,0,0,0,,So they're using that as basically their cue in the environment
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.49,0:09:07.15,Chinese,,0,0,0,,总的来说，它们就用荧光作为环境信号
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.15,0:09:09.19,English,,0,0,0,,and saying, you know okay, this is how bright it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.15,0:09:09.19,Chinese,,0,0,0,,来感知外面有多亮，
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.19,0:09:11.96,English,,0,0,0,,So that's a cue as to how likely I'm being preyed upon.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.19,0:09:11.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这也是我成为猎物的概率，
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.96,0:09:13.60,English,,0,0,0,,And then here's how hungry I am.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.96,0:09:13.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并知道自己有多饿，
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.60,0:09:16.06,English,,0,0,0,,That's a cue how badly I need to get out and get some food.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.60,0:09:16.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这又是一个信号，表明我有多么需要外出觅食
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.06,0:09:16.53,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.06,0:09:16.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,对
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.53,0:09:20.90,English,,0,0,0,,- [Carl] And then the trade off between those two is basically should I go out tonight or should I stay in my hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.53,0:09:20.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而这两者的权衡大概就是，今晚是该出去还是留在洞里
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.90,0:09:21.48,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.90,0:09:21.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,是的
