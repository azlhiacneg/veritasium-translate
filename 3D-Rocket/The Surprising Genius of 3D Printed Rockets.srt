1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,710
- This is the world's largest 3D metal printer.
这是世界上最大的3D金属打印机
2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,060
It was built by Relativity Space,
由Relativity Space公司打造
3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,090
a startup that aims to print an entire rocket,
这家初创公司的目标是
4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,510
including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days.
在60天内，打印一支包括了燃料仓和发动机的火箭
5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,650
I'm like looking inside a 3D printed rocket
我面前的就是一支3D打印的火箭
6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,970
that is actually gonna go to space.
而且它真的能飞上太空
7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,610
This giant hunk of metal, it's unbelievable.
这么一大块金属，真是难以置信
8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,850
This video is sponsored by Omaze.
本视频由Omaze赞助
9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,060
Offering you the chance to win a trip to space.
他能提供一个让你赢得太空之旅的机会
10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,053
More about that at the end of the show.
详情请见视频结尾
11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,480
- There's a lot of UV coming off the welds,
焊接点会有很强的紫外线
12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,490
you can film it, but don't look directly at it.
拍摄没问题，但是不要用眼睛直接看
13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,120
You get sunburned fast, 
强紫外线会让人很快晒伤，
14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,710
so it's like you're suiting up to go in a volcano.
所以我们全副武装，按照进火山的标准来
15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,270
All right, we're gonna go in to the 3D printer,
好了，我们现在能进去看看
16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,253
and see how it works.
3D打印机是怎么工作的
17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,050
All right, so, yep, just hold this up.
好啦，可以，拿着这个
18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,900
Don't look at it.
别直接看
19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,270
We are in the printer.
我们进入了这里
20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,810
- I can see it over there.
能看到打印机就在前面
21
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,658
- If we walk around here, we can get up close.
走这边能看得近一点
22
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:58,741
(machinery whirring)

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,300
(machinery beating)

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,040
So that's the wire melt team,
这个就是线材融化模组
25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,230
and the print head moving around.
打印头在不断移动
26
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,790
So that's the plasma discharge, and it's hard to tell,
等离子体在放电，我不确定具体时长
27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,150
but it's doing things every couple of milliseconds,
大约几毫秒放电一次
28
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,551
it's actually changing the electric wave form,
通过不断改变放电的波形
29
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,700
which is how it's controlling the deposition so well.
来来控制金属的精确沉积
30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,930
- Do you know the temperature of it?
你知道这里的温度么？
31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,533
Like, is it just above melt temp?
比方说，温度刚刚超过了熔点？
32
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,410
- It's just above melting for aluminum.
是的，比铝的熔点高一些
33
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,120
Yeah, probably a few hundred degrees above.
大概几百度吧
34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,930
- The melting point of aluminum is 660 degrees Celsius.
铝的熔点约为660摄氏度
35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,560
So the whole body of the rocket
所以，整个火箭的身体
36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,533
is effectively melted together one tiny bit at a time.
都是一点点融化再凝固得来的
37
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,480
- All the raw metal
火箭所需所有的原材料就是这个
38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,200
for the whole rocket that's printed is this.
火箭所需所有的原材料就是这个
39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,090
It's a, you know, we kind of joke
我们都开玩笑
40
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,656
it's like Charlotte's web.
这就是“夏洛特的网”
41
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:49,463
Like a spider silk, but this is an aluminum alloy
就行蜘蛛丝一样，但这里是铝合金丝
42
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,600
that's on a wire spool.
绕线盘上都是
43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,260
We actually print about 10 inches a second.
打印速度大约每秒10英寸（每秒25厘米）
44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,150
So this wire is really going super fast,
这个线跑得飞快
45
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,660
and then the combination of lasers and plasma arc discharge
然后激光和等离子体放电共同作用
46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,750
are working to melt both of them together at the same time.
把铝合金丝融化
47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,810
- So where does the wire come out?
铝丝从哪儿出来？
48
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,580
- So it's right there, and then the electric arc discharge
这里，然后电弧在尖端处放电
49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,100
happens right at the tip of the wire too.
这里，然后电弧在尖端处放电
50
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,020
- This is a camera.
- Yeah, that's a camera.
这是摄像头？对
51
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,630
- But why would you want to 3D print a rocket?
但是，为什么我们要3D打印火箭呢？
52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,460
Is it just because we can?
就因为我们有这个能力？
53
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,660
It's funny to me that
听起来这很有趣
54
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,010
you had this experience with 3D printing where you're like,
你有3D打印的体验
55
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,240
oh, 3D printing is clearly the future.
然后说，啊，3D打印可是未来科技啊
56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,830
Whereas, I feel like a lot of people's experience
然而，很多人和我一样，用3D打印的体验
57
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,610
with 3D printers as mine has been,
然而，很多人和我一样，用3D打印的体验
58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,180
it's like incredibly frustrating.
都惨不忍睹
59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,240
I feel like 3D printing is that thing
我感觉3D打印就是那种看起来不错
60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,850
that seems like it should be great,
我感觉3D打印就是那种看起来不错
61
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,700
and yet whenever I try it,
一上手亲自做，总是得不到满意的效果
62
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,430
I don't get a result that I'm happy with.
一上手亲自做，总是得不到满意的效果
63
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,440
- Yeah, I know.
是，我明白
64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,550
I can tell you, we had plenty of experiences
我想说的是，在头几年，我们有很多（失败）的经验
65
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,540
the first couple of years,
我想说的是，在头几年，我们有很多（失败）的经验
66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,769
where we ended up with a pile of metal and it didn't work.
打印出来一大堆东西，结果根本不能用
67
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,290
- But there are actually good reasons to 3D print a rocket.
不过用3D打印技术来生产火箭还是有很充足理由
68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,470
A rocket has four major systems.
火箭由四个主要系统构成
69
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,060
Payload, guidance, structural, and propulsion.
载荷、制导、结构、推进
70
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,920
The bulk of the rocket is made up of the propulsion system,
火箭很大一部分都是推进系统
71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,070
including the propellant tanks and the rocket engines.
包括了燃料仓和火箭发动机
72
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,540
Cryogenic fuel and oxidizer are pumped
燃料和助燃剂由燃料泵喷入燃烧室内
73
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,920
through an injector into the combustion chamber
燃料和助燃剂由燃料泵喷入燃烧室内
74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,760
where they react, releasing an enormous amount of heat.
反应燃烧后产生大量的热
75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,231
This causes the exhaust gases to expand,
使得排出的气体迅速膨胀
76
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,600
exiting the rocket nozzle at high velocity.
以极高的速度排出发动机喷嘴
77
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,310
The faster this exit velocity
出口速度越快
78
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,940
and the higher the mass flow rate,
喷出工质的速率越高
79
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,510
the more thrust that can be generated.
火箭发动机产生的推力就越大
80
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,070
So rockets are huge, complex engineering projects,
因此，火箭是一项极为庞大，极为复杂的工程项目
81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,570
which up to this point have largely been manufactured
同时，现阶段还是通过传统的手段来建造的
82
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,250
using traditional techniques.
同时，现阶段还是通过传统的手段来建造的
83
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,524
That means before you can build the rocket,
也就是说，要想造一支火箭
84
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:39,140
you first have to build the tools to build the rocket.
你需要先制造出能够加工火箭的工具（类似船坞）
85
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,360
For example, to build NASA's next huge rocket,
比方说，为了制造NASA的下一支大火箭
86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,810
the Space Launch System or SLS,
太空发射系统，简称SLS
87
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,090
they first needed to construct
他们先建造了垂直组装中心（VAC）
88
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,033
the vertical assembly center or VAC.
他们先建造了垂直组装中心（VAC）
89
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,740
This is a 170 foot tall tool for welding together
这是个将170英尺（约51.8米）的大家伙
90
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,200
the domes, rings, and barrel sections
用于焊接燃料仓的仓顶，仓壁以及加强环
91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,350
of the rocket's fuel tanks.
用于焊接燃料仓的仓顶，仓壁以及加强环
92
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,410
- They built that like an aerospace thing,
他们就像建造航天飞机那样
93
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,740
and they've had to spin up all these custom tooling designs
采用了大量的定制工具
94
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,140
and validate that those work
并在实际建造之前进行大量的验证工作
95
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,530
before actually starts
building the rocket.
并在实际建造之前进行大量的验证工作
96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,720
And they finally got one being assembled on the pad
最终，花了11年才在发射台上组装好
97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,370
after 11 years of development.
最终，花了11年才在发射台上组装好
98
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,570
In contrast, Relativity Space the company,
相较而言，Relativity Space公司刚刚成立五年半
99
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,091
is just five and a half years old,
相较而言，Relativity Space公司刚刚成立五年半
100
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:18,579
and they plan to launch their first rocket this year.
今年就准备发射他们的第一支火箭了
101
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,079
- I see this as a like old engineering style
在我看来，这就是传统模式和硅谷模式的区别
102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,342
versus Silicon valley
style of build something,
在我看来，这就是传统模式和硅谷模式的区别
103
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,030
figure out what's wrong with it,
找出当前存在的问他
104
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,360
and build another thing that fixes those, right?
然后快速迭代，改进问题
105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,995
The differences, I've always done that with software.
在软件领域，这种做法很常见
106
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:35,680
These guys are doing it with aerospace hardware.
但是这些人正在太空硬件领域实现它
107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,649
- So this is the actual rocket tank structure
这个就是真正的火箭燃料仓
108
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,930
of what we're gonna be launching to orbit
今年年底发射的火箭就要用上了
109
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,763
at the end of this year.
今年年底发射的火箭就要用上了
110
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,103
So this actual thing is launching to space.
这是真正能上天的玩意儿
111
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:45,580
- That will go to space?
就是这个要上天？
112
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,790
- This will go to space,
就是它要上天
113
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,250
and it's by far the largest 3D printed product really,
目前为止，在世界上所有能飞的东西里，这是最大的3D打印部件
114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,950
of any type ever made that's gonna fly.
目前为止，在世界上所有能飞的东西里，这是最大的3D打印部件
115
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,830
I think maybe of any type in the world.
也许连不能飞的也算上，它也是最大的
116
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,170
- But it still looks 3D printed.
但是很明显这个还是3D打印的
117
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,580
Like you can still see the layers.
还是能看到一层层的
118
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,910
- Yeah, yeah, you can still see the layers.
对对，能看到一层层的
119
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,600
It only adds an extra 5 to 10% of the mass
这样的粗糙度，会增加5%到10%的重量
120
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,860
with the roughness.
这样的粗糙度，会增加5%到10%的重量
121
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,030
When you actually cross section the material
当你检查材料的横断面时
122
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,070
and look at the machine parts of it,
当你检查材料的横断面时
123
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,360
it looks like normal metal.
与普通材料并无二致
124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
Like actually at this end, this is printed as well.
尾部这里也是3D打印的
125
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
We just machine it afterwards.
我们后期又进行了加工
126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,360
So it looks like normal metal in the joint sections.
连接处看起来和普通金属一样
127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,520
- Does the surface roughness cause any aerodynamic problems?
这样粗糙的表面会影响气动性能么？
128
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
- No, none at all.
不会，完全不会
129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,560
Yeah, it's actually the exact same aerodynamically.
空气动力性能完全一致
130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
This whole thing, we simulate the print before printing,
整个构件在打印前进行了模拟打印
131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,060
because if you just printed, you know, the 3D file
如果你直接把3D模型扔进去
132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,730
and said press print, you would end up with a printer
按打印键的话，成品会受热扭曲
133
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,270
that's warped and like material falling all over the place
打印头无法把材料沉积上去，全都撒掉了
134
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,700
that wouldn't actually work.
火箭也没法用了
135
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,860
So we've invented software that reverse warps
所以我们的打印软件会自动抵消部件的扭曲
136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,980
the whole part before printing it.
所以我们的打印软件会自动抵消部件的扭曲
137
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,700
So the robots are actually doing this
机器人才能在扭曲后的部件上完成打印
138
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,822
really wobbly, weird shape,
机器人才能在扭曲后的部件上完成打印
139
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,860
but then it's actually perfectly straight
最终的成果非常精确
140
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,270
within a human hair at the entire length.
误差不会超过一根头发
141
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,250
- As it cools
- As it cools.
-当它冷却之后 -对，当它冷却后
142
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,650
The warpy thing turns into the...
扭曲的部件能够变成（笔直的火箭）
143
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,070
- And then we simulate all of that.
我们模拟了这些扭曲
144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,514
So it's a big computational solver that simulates it,
模拟这些是个很大型的计算过程
145
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:08,250
and there's many, many other problems
同时还有很多很多其他的问题
146
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,120
we've had to solve to actually get
解决了这些问题
147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,430
printing a rocket to work.
才能打印出能用的火箭来
148
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,340
But it's all these little pieces
而这也只是这些年中遇到问题的一部分
149
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,664
over the last couple of years,
而这也只是这些年中遇到问题的一部分
150
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:17,470
and we've really started to hit some breakthroughs,
然后我们开始取得了一些突破性进展
151
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,770
which is also why now you see a whole rocket.
因此才能看到这里的一整个火箭
152
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,230
Yeah, you can step up here actually if you want.
你可以站上来
153
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,063
- Can I?
可以吗？
154
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:23,896
- Yeah, yeah.
可以

155
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,420
(man laughs)
哈哈哈哈哈哈

156
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,490
- Hello.
有人吗

157
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,650
I'm like looking inside a 3D printed rocket
这个3D打印的火箭之后可是要进入太空的

158
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,980
that is actually gonna go to space.
而我现在正在朝里面看

159
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,877
- Yes.
确实

160
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,850
- This giant hunk of metal.
这一大块金属

161
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,033
It's unbelievable.
真是让人难以置信

162
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,280
There's like rings inside.
这里面看起来有一圈一圈的圆环

163
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,250
- Those are printed in stiffeners.
那些是一体化打印的加强筋

164
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,400
And so those help prevent the rocket
防止火箭外壳扭曲变形

165
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,010
from buckling and crumpling.

166
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,600
So if you had a Coke can, and didn't pop the tab,
例如你有一个没开封的可乐罐

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,260
if you try to step on it, it's almost impossible
你用脚几乎不可能把它踩瘪

168
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,700
because there's pressure inside
因为罐内有气压让它保持坚挺

169
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,980
that keeps it from buckling.

170
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,240
But then when you pop the tab,
一旦你拉开拉环

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,920
there's no pressure and you can crunch it super easy.
里面压力和外部相同了，你很容易就能把罐子压瘪

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,100
It's not hard at all.
几乎不费吹灰之力

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,340
So rockets are the same.
火箭本体也是这样

174
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,550
The 50 PSI of pressure,
火箭内部有50磅每平方英寸（约3.4个标准大气压）的压强

175
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,706
which is about the same as a car tire,
跟汽车车轮内的压强差不多

176
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,940
keeps it inflated and keeps it from crumpling,
这个压强使火箭不至于变形或者瘪下去

177
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,320
but then the stiffeners also help keep it rigid.
加强筋的作用就是让它变得更牢固

178
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
- Yeah, so believe it or not,
还有一点就是

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,250
a rocket tank is thinner versus its diameter
如果用厚度和直径做比值的话，火箭燃料箱的相对厚度比可乐罐还要薄

180
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,280
than a Coke can.

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,050
So when you look at a Coke can,
你知道一个可乐罐有多大，以及它的侧壁有多薄吧

182
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,890
you know how big it is and then how thin it is,

183
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,010
a rocket tank is actually thinner than that.
按比例的话，火箭燃料箱比可乐罐还薄

184
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,660
So yeah, it's pretty light.
总之燃料箱是很轻的

185
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,700
It has to be very light.
它必须得做得轻才行

186
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,570
- Sure.
是啊

187
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,360
Aerospace companies started using metal 3D printing
航空技术公司早在10几年前就开始用3D打印技术打印一些复杂的小零部件了

188
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,410
over a decade ago to construct small complex parts.

189
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,280
For example, the injector.
比如说燃料喷射装置

190
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,720
- That is the most important part of any rocket engine,
这是火箭发动机上最重要的部件

191
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,093
where you basically gotta take the liquid propellant,
液体燃料在此处被雾化然后迅速混合

192
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:46,800
and turn it into a fine mist
that mixes really rapidly.

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,170
And those have actually been transitioned
现在在整个航空业中我们都使用3D打印来制造这个部件

194
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,890
to 3D printing all over the industry.

195
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,700
- Traditionally, something like this,
传统的燃料喷射装置

196
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,590
it's a bucket engine injector.

197
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,040
So it mixes liquid oxygen
把液氧和液体甲烷混合

198
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,460
and liquid methane propellants together,

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,170
and this is what actually produces all the fire and flame
这就是产生所有那些火光和火焰的地方

200
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,470
that is in a rocket engine.
这个就是所谓的火箭发动机

201
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,869
Traditionally, it would be over a thousand individual pieces
以前的话，需要用超过一千个零部件

202
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,970
and it would take nine months,
耗时9个月

203
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,120
but here we're 3D printing the whole thing in one piece.
现在我们用3D打印一气呵成

204
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,420
It takes two weeks and it costs 10 times less.
只需要2个星期，成本还只有原来的十分之一

205
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,270
- One of the big benefits of 3D printing
3D打印最大的好处之一就是

206
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,590
is reducing the number of parts.
可以减少零部件的数量

207
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,530
Have you ever thought about
你有没有想过火箭的燃烧室中有多高的温度？

208
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,380
how inside a rockets combustion
chamber, it gets really hot.

209
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,010
Up to 3,500 Kelvin.
温度可以高达3500开尔文

210
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,150
That's hot enough to melt virtually any metal.
这个温度可以熔化几乎任何金属

211
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,230
So how do the combustion chamber and rocket nozzle not melt?
那么燃烧室和火箭喷口为什么没熔化？

212
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,530
The answer is they're cooled by passing
因为外部环绕有低温推进剂给它们降温

213
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,030
the cryogenic propellants over them.

214
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,590
- On the Space Shuttle main engines.
在航天飞机的主引擎里

215
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,590
I love to talk about them because inside those engines,
这个话题我想想都激动

216
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,000
it's hot enough to boil iron.
引擎内部的温度足以让铁水沸腾

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,710
On the outside, you can freeze stuff
而引擎的外部还在结冰呢

218
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,883
to the exterior of this because you're running liquid
因为外部有循环流动的液氢

219
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,280
hydrogen through these things.

220
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,210
But to make those,
但是，为了达到冷却的效果

221
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,150
you basically had to take thousands of very small pipes,
需要做数千根极细的管子

222
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,380
and then you would form them
并且把管子做成符合燃烧室和喷嘴的形状

223
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,520
into the shape of the combustion chamber and the nozzle,

224
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,510
and then you would braze
weld them together.
然后再把它们钎焊到一起

225
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,940
And this was a ridiculously
labor-intensive task.
这无比的费时费力

226
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,200
You would have 1,080 individual
pipes running up the side,
因为总共有1080根管子

227
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,310
all having to be weld together

228
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,540
to make the combustion chamber and the nozzle
需要焊接在航天飞机引擎燃烧室和喷嘴的外壁

229
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,650
on the Space Shuttle engines.

230
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,760
So you can actually 3D print these things.
而其实这些完全可以3D打印出来

231
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,300
- This is a rocket nozzle being 3D printed,
现在正在3D打印的就是一个火箭喷嘴

232
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,880
and you can see the channels for the cryogenic propellants
你可以看到用来运输低温推进剂的管道

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,100
being printed right into the single part
是一体打印上去的

234
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,990
instead of having to add a thousand pipes on the outside.
而不需要再额外加上一千根管子

235
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,510
Smaller parts like these are typically 3D printed
通常像这样的小部件都是用金属粉末和激光3D打印而成的

236
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,030
using metal powder and lasers.

237
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,560
- So you can see the cooling channels
你看这些冷却管道是这样一体制作而成

238
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,978
are all being built as the one piece.

239
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,720
So this is a nozzle.
这是一个喷口

240
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,350
It really just lays down a layer of powder
打印机每次铺一层金属粉

241
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,330
that's about a 20th the thickness of a human hair.
厚度大概是头发的二十分之一

242
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,258
So it's really, really fine layers
就是很薄很薄的一层

243
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:57,690
just over and over and over and over relentlessly
但是不断地重复重复再重复

244
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,820
for probably about a week or so,
差不多一个星期

245
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,660
and then out comes the rocket nozzle
一个一体成形的火箭喷口就大功告成了

246
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,630
all printed as one piece.

247
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,550
It's way cheaper than traditional.
这比传统方法便宜多了

248
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,890
And this has four lasers going at once.
而且这个是四束激光同时工作

249
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,060
- That's amazing.
太赞了

250
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,100
- I get asked a lot, weren't 3D printed metals
经常有人问3D打印出来的金属会不会强度不够

251
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,200
not very strong?

252
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,180
Or how can it actually work?
甚至质疑这真的能行吗

253
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,750
But the printed materials are stronger
其实打印出来的材料比用传统方法制成的强度要更大

254
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,960
than they would be built
traditionally, actually.

255
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,090
It's counterintuitive.
这有点反直觉

256
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,923
- It is.
是啊

257
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,860
- Because we develop our own custom alloys in house.
我们使用的合金是自己研发的

258
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,360
So we have a whole material science team
我们有一个材料科学的团队专门负责研发3D打印所用的合金

259
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,990
just developing our own
alloys for 3D printing,

260
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,070
and the fact that it melts and then cools and solidifies
因为材料在极短的时间内从熔化到冷却到固化

261
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,430
very, very quickly, you can take advantage
我们可以利用这个物理原理

262
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,640
of that physics principle to get really strong alloys.
来得到强度很高的合金

263
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,260
- Another major benefit of 3D printing
3D打印带来的另一个好处是产品可以快速迭代

264
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,580
is that it allows for rapid iteration.

265
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,870
You can build a part quickly, test it,
部件建造起来很快，对它进行测试以后

266
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,900
and then redesign rapidly and print again.
又能很迅速地重新设计然后打印出来

267
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,280
- So this is a version of the engine
这个引擎是3年前的版本

268
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,400
that's about three
years old at this point,

269
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,940
but what's amazing is when you actually look
你再看看我们现在的引擎

270
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,430
at the engine design today,

271
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,440
it looks entirely different than this.
完全就不一样了

272
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,060
So each version we build, we can iterate and make better.
我们每个版本，都能快速迭代，愈发完善

273
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,750
So that's the other, you know,
这个就是所谓的

274
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,590
when we say software driven manufacturing,
「软件驱动型制造」

275
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,050
that's really what it is.
说的很有道理

276
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,870
Since you don't have fixed tooling,
因为不需要固定式加工设备

277
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,170
all the part geometries are just controlled
所有部件的几何学特性都由电脑辅助设计模型（CAD）所控制

278
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,801
via the CAD model, and then the printers just print
打印机只需要按照文件内容打印就行了

279
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,270
direct from file essentially.

280
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,500
It means you can actually change the design extremely fast.
因此想要更改设计就变得易如反掌

281
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,420
So building a whole engine only takes us about a month.
制造一个完整的引擎只需要花费差不多一个月

282
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,610
So then a month later, you can do a better version,
一个月以后，一个更好的版本就制造好了

283
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,622
and a month later, a better version than that.
如此迭代

284
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:29,600
So this particular one will actually be,
你现在看到的这个

285
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,890
I believe one of the first flight engines
应该是第一个在真实发射时会用到的引擎

286
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,720
that's actually launching to orbit on our first rocket.

287
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,170
- So this tubing, not 3D printed, right?
这些管道应该不是3D打印的吧？

288
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,200
- Not today.
现在还不是

289
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,033
- Okay.
确实

290
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,500
- In the future versions, we're actually integrating that
未来的话，我们正在把这些管道也整合进需要打印的部分

291
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,931
into the printed housings.

292
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,430
And we're gonna have a way that that's all printed too.
我们之后会想办法让这个变成纯3D打印的

293
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,850
- Perhaps the biggest impact
3D打印的使用

294
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,830
of the 3D printing approach could be to totally transform
最大的影响可能是会颠覆火箭的外形

295
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,200
what a rocket looks like.

296
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
With 3D printing, engineers can build parts
有了3D打印，可以制造出一些在传统方法看来不实际或是不可能的结构

297
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,840
that would be impractical or impossible

298
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,460
with traditional techniques.

299
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,207
Smooth, curvy, bio-inspired designs
光滑的，弯曲的，仿生的设计

300
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:06,290
are just as easy to print
as ordinary structures.
与普通结构同样易于打印

301
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,660
- This is actually part of our next rocket, Terran R.
这个是我们下一代火箭 「人族R」的一部分

302
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,360
So it's even larger.
还更大了哈

303
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,190
- This is like the base of a tank.
这个看起来像是燃料箱的底座

304
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,050
- Yeah. Yeah.
没错

305
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,180
So it's gonna go out.
它大概有...

306
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,580
It's almost done printing.
这几乎全是打印出来的

307
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,733
It's gonna go out about to here.
它大概向外能到这儿

308
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:21,502
So it's 16 foot diameter, but it's almost like a shell.
直径16英尺，外形像个贝壳

309
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:24,460
- I was gonna say like,
this reminds me of suddenly
啊我也想说，这个突然就让我以为

310
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,820
we're in The Little Mermaid or something.
我们身处在 小美人鱼 还是什么电影里面

311
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,220
- Yeah, yeah.
是啊是啊

312
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,490
Yeah, it's just for stiffness though.
这个外形主要是因为它稳固

313
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,550
- It's not that you plan to make it bio inspired.
不是说我们故意想把它造成仿生的

314
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,150
It's like that structure is actually the optimal structure.
而是这个结构就是最优结构

315
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,690
- Yeah, yeah.
嗯对

316
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,390
- We're actually designing many features in the rocket
这个火箭的设计里

317
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,000
that could not be manufactured
unless it was 3D printed,
有好多都是只能用3D打印完成的

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,100
which is one of the secret sauces
这也是为什么我们要开一家公司来对付这些秘密配方

319
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,970
of why you had to build a
whole company around it,

320
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,400
is because our rocket actually looks
我们3D打印出来的火箭与传统火箭将会是截然不同的

321
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,610
entirely different 3D printed than it does traditionally.

322
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,670
Like in my mind, it's been more akin
我觉得用内燃机向电动机的转变类比比较合适

323
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,280
to like gas internal
combustion engine to electric.

324
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,880
You know, really, people are trying to put batteries
一直以来汽车厂商都想在现有的汽车里装上电池和电动机

325
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,800
and electric motors into
existing products for decades.

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,080
Like everyone knew electric vehicles were the future,
因为大家都知道电动汽车才是未来趋势

327
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,226
but Nissan and Ford had really not compelling products
而日产和福特很长一段时间都没什么让人种草的产品了

328
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,750
for a long time.

329
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,460
It wasn't until a company came along called Tesla
直到有个叫特斯拉的公司反应过来

330
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,390
that decided, well, actually
the shift to electrification
啊，朝着电气化的转变

331
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,100
means the batteries, the electric motors, the factory,
意味着电池、电动机、工厂

332
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,420
the design of the product,
产品设计

333
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,240
how we're actually gonna scale the company,
公司规模

334
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
the supply chain, all of it's different
供给链这一系列的转变

335
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,620
because of electrification.

336
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,940
I mean, that's in some ways,
从某种程度上说

337
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,840
the dirty secret of electric cars
总体零件少了很多

338
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,420
and why they're able to be automated in production
就是电动车成功，以及能快速生产的「肮脏秘密」

339
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,700
because the part count is so much lower.


340
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,360
So for a fully 3D printed rocket,
对于3D打印的火箭

341
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,270
we have a hundred times fewer parts,
我们要达到的目标就是只使用百分之一的零件数量

342
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,150
which is what we're guiding to.

343
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,487
There's no fixed tooling in our factory at all.
在我们工厂里不存在固定式加工设备

344
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,580
Unlike the rest of aerospace
反观其他航空制造企业

345
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,450
that's still really, 60 years later,
还在用60年前阿波罗时代的方法

346
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,300
even since Apollo. Building products

347
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,840
one at a time by hand with hundreds of thousands
手工打造成千上万个零部件

348
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,920
to millions of individual parts.

349
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,310
And no one's really changed that paradigm
这种航空制造的模式还没人打破呢

350
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,825
of how an aerospace factory actually fundamentally works.

351
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,195
- Yeah, this is the new fully 3D printed rocket.
这就是完全3D打印的新火箭

352
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,750
So yeah, we'll have dragonfly wing type structures
嗯，我们会仿造蜻蜓翅膀的结构设计格栅翼

353
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,920
and we're building it so.
我们已经开始制造了

354
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,950
But that's the first one,
不过，左边那台才是初号机

355
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,340
and then that's that one for scale.
那台是尺寸更大的版本

356
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,660
So yeah, it is definitely bigger.
嗯，绝对大了一圈

357
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,210
Yeah, so our rocket is named
Terran One and Terran R,
是的，我们把火箭命名为 「人族一号」 和 「人族R」

358
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,838
and then our 3D printer's Stargate.
3D打印机则被称为 「星际之门」

359
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:23,650
So all the things here at Relativity
Relativity 制造的所有产品

360
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,666
are named after StarCraft.
名字都来源于 「星际争霸」 这款游戏

361
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,050
So yeah, of course, the Stargate printer
啊哈，「星际之门」 

362
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,030
was with the Protoss
used to warp in spaceships.
本来是「神族」乘坐太空飞船时扭曲空间所用的工具

363
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,521
And so, that's what's warping
in spaceships at Relativity.
所以，那就是 Relativity 用来改变太空飞船的利器

364
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,980
We have a system in our
avionics called the Pylon
我们的产品中，有一套名为「水晶塔」的系统

365
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,150
that we have to build a lot of.
这套系统我们需求量很大

366
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,360
So we always joke, we have to
construct additional Pylons.
所以我们经常开玩笑说，我们还得多造一点「水晶塔」啊

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,496
Most people don't know how rockets
很多人对于传统的火箭制造方式

368
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:48,950
are built traditionally at all anyway.
也所知甚少

369
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,180
And I think a lot of
people assume it's rockets,
我觉得，许多人以为这是火箭

370
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,360
so shouldn't it be already very advanced
那它就应该已经非常先进了

371
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,540
and robots everywhere and you know,
生产线上全是机器人，你知道的

372
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Elon's got Space X and Tesla,
马斯克有SpaceX和Tesla两家公司

373
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,760
so doesn't Space X just look like Tesla
那SpaceX难道不像Tesla那样

374
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,798
with all these robots and automation?
同样有这些机器人和自动化的设备

375
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,340
But that's really not true.
但这大错特错了

376
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,157
I mean, aerospace hasn't
adopted automation at all.
我想说的是，航空工业并没有完全接纳自动化

377
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,850
- One of the issues, right,
is that you're not making
其中一个问题就是，恩，你总不会一次性制造

378
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,260
a lot of rockets?
很多的火箭吧？

379
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,093
- Right?
对吧？

380
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:14,810
- So there's no incentive
to like figure out
所以并没有那么大的需求去刺激他们

381
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,280
how to tool up a factory
to like pump out rockets
设计出一种自动化的工厂，用来大量生产火箭

382
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,590
like a hundred a day or something.
比如每天生产一百枚的那种

383
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,423
- Exactly.
是这样

384
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:20,256
- Like you would for cars.
就像生产汽车那样

385
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,540
- Exactly, you're not making a lot.
的确，你并不会造那么多

386
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,980
Even with commercial aircraft,
即使是商用的飞机

387
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,450
you're not making nearly as many
也完全达不到那么多的产量

388
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,770
and there's orders of magnitude
more parts and complexity.
另外航空器的零部件数量和复杂程度与其他相比是差了数量级的

389
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,290
A commercial aircraft has
several million individual parts.
一架商用飞机有数以百万计独立的零件

390
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,234
So to have robots assemble
several million parts
让机器人组装数百万个零件

391
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,830
when an automobile has tens of thousands
和仅有数万零件的汽车相比

392
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,250
is completely different.
是完全不同的

393
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,780
It's a much harder problem.
这个问题难多了

394
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,230
So that's where 3D printing
is automation for aerospace
所以，在我们这里，3D打印实现了航空业的自动化

395
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,340
because you're not assembling
all those parts with robots
因为你并不是像装配汽车那样

396
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,030
like you would with a car,
用机器人组装所有的组件

397
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,600
you're assembling them in the 3D file
你是预先在3D文件里设计整合好它们

398
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,450
and then the printer just
prints them assembled.
然后打印机以组装好的状态打印出它们

399
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,660
- The plan for Relativity Space,
Relativity Space 的计划

400
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,320
is it low-earth orbit or is
it going further than that?
是专注于近地轨道，还是会有更远的目标？

401
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,870
- So for Terran One, it's
mostly low earth orbit.
对于「人族一号」而言，主要是近地轨道

402
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,204
The first rocket.
这是我们的第一款火箭

403
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:08,560
Terran R can actually send
payload to the moon to Mars.
而「人族R」实际上可以把载荷送往月球和火星

404
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,350
I mean, it's pretty, pretty huge.
它的运力相当巨大

405
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,750
I founded the company
because I really thought
我创立这家公司，因为我真心觉得

406
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,420
that there needed to be, you know,
你明白的，需要有

407
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,870
dozens of hundreds of
companies making Mars happen.
数以千计的公司一起努力，使得前往火星成为现实

408
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,460
We're focused on taking
this 3D printing tech
我们专注于这种3D打印科技

409
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,620
and what we call the
factory of the future,
还有被我们称为未来工厂的概念

410
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,418
and one day shrinking it down to something
在未来的某一天将它压缩成

411
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:26,350
we'll actually launch to Mars
and build an industrial base.
我们能够真正发射到火星的小工厂
并且建起一个工业基地

412
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,580
So that's the long-term
vision of the company,
那是我们公司的长期愿景

413
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,640
is build the industrial base on Mars.
就是在火星建立这种工业基地

414
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,050
In many ways, this factory
is just a prototype.
在许多方面，这种工厂还只是一个原型

415
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,120
It's still far smaller
than a traditional factory.
它仍然远小于传统的工厂

416
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,220
It's far lighter.
它的分量小得多

417
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,220
And I think it's inevitable
但是不可避免总有人要创建这样的公司

418
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,270
someone has to build this company.


419
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,140
- I don't know that in 10, 20 years
我不知道，在十年，或者二十年后

420
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,220
that you will be 3D printing
rockets all the time.
你会不会随时能乘坐3D打印的火箭

421
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,440
Because if you are flying lots of rockets,
因为如果有大量的火箭投入运营

422
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,840
it becomes cheaper to have
a dedicated machine for it.
拥有这样一个火箭的花费会更少

423
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,851
I do think that as a
company, they are well-placed
我认为，作为一家公司，他们的定位相当重要

424
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:57,440
because even if Terran fails
to capitalize on the market,
因为即使「人族」系列没能在市场上发挥优势

425
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,040
even if nobody wants to
use it as a launch vehicle,
即使没人愿意用它作为发射载具

426
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,840
they are clearly now the world experts
我们显然是目前世界级的

427
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,680
on 3D printing rocket hardware,
3D打印火箭硬件专家

428
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,569
'cause they've done everything, right?
因为他们把所有问题都解决了，不是吗

429
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,519
They've tried to apply
3D printing to places
他们努力将3D打印应用在

430
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,970
where a lot of people dismissed it.
被许多人忽视的领域

431
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,950
So I think they're sort
of secure as a company.
所以我觉得他们作为一家公司，地位是相当稳固的

432
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:18,000
Whether we will see rockets
being 3D printed all the time?
我们会不会看到火箭完全由3D打印制造的那天呢

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,903
That's a good question.
这是个好问题

434
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,270
- There've been a lot of talk recently
最近有许多的讨论

435
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,579
about billionaires going to space.
有关于前往太空的大富豪们

436
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,669
- Yeah.
是的

437
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,137
- Will a 3D printed
rocket make it possible
3D打印的火箭会使前往太空变得可行

438
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:31,180
and a lot cheaper for me to go to space?
并且为我节省一大笔钱吗

439
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,330
- Yes, I mean, certainly what we're doing
是的，我想说的是，很明显我们在做的

440
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,720
is lowering the cost.
正是降低费用

441
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,800
So our rockets are
costing about five times
所以说，我们的火箭花费会比当今的可回收火箭便宜五倍

442
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,260
to, you know, I believe we can get to 10
到，emm，我觉得我们可以达到十倍

443
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,980
or even a hundred times cheaper
甚至能达到一百倍

444
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,000
with a fully reusable rocket
than what we have today.


445
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,687
So it can definitely
climb down the cost curve.
那么这绝对能压低成本曲线

446
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,966
But I also think, you know, going to Mars
不过，我还觉得，emm，前往火星

447
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,192
and the first people that are going,
还有最先到达那里的人

448
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,986
it really is about what is the
point of being a human being?
重要的是成为人类的意义是什么

449
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:00,000
Like for me, why go to Mars?
比方说，对我而言，为什么要去火星？

450
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
If we were having this conversation
假如我们正在谈这个话题

451
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,009
and a million people were
living on another planet,
而一百万人住在另一个星球

452
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,046
I think it would expand the possibilities
我想，这将带来更多可能性

453
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,114
of human experience and what
it means to be a person.
人类的体验和生而为人的意义

454
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,915
Like we'd have YouTube channels on Mars
就像，我们可以开个关于火星的频道

455
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:16,003
and people sharing what life
on Mars is like versus earth.
人们可以分享在火星的生活是怎样的，并且和地球比较

456
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,692
And there'd be long distance
Amelie, like love stories.
还会有异地版的「天使艾美丽」，爱情故事之类的

457
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:21,249
Like I think there's
just a lot of richness
就像我觉得，人类有很多可能性

458
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:25,332
in what human culture
and society can be about.
文化和社会的演进令人期待

459
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,507
Yes, I think there's criticism about,
当然，我想会有一些批评，关于，

460
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,485
you know, billionaires going to space
你懂的，大富豪上太空之类的

461
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,306
and I don't agree with.
对这些声音我不敢苟同

462
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:32,945
You know, all of the projects
你明白的，所有这些计划

463
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,350
need to actually add up to
some vision that is meaningful.
都需要被赋予一个有意义的愿景

464
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,023
I think that's really important.
我觉得那真的很重要

465
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,926
But I do think going to
Mars is really just about,
但我不觉得去火星仅仅是为了

466
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,972
you know, we've lived
for generations on earth,
emm，我们世世代代生活在地球上

467
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,966
so what's it all about like,
那，去火星是怎样的感觉？

468
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:48,660
why do we want to keep
improving and getting better
我们为什么想要改进

469
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,933
and furthering society on earth?
并且拓展地球上的社会

470
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,689
So for me, it's pretty existential.
对我而言，这是相当存在主义的问题

471
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,632
What it means to be a human being.
成为人类意味着什么呢

472
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:57,963
(techy sound effect)
