Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.34,0:09:38.26,English,,0,0,0,,- Either.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.34,0:09:38.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- 都是。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.26,0:09:40.85,English,,0,0,0,,Any kind of this getting into the inner tail rotor
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.85,0:09:43.38,English,,0,0,0,,would be destruction to the aircraft.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.26,0:09:43.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,任何这种东西如果跑到了尾部马达里面，那这飞机就无了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.36,0:10:03.23,English,,0,0,0,,And we 'll start,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.36,0:10:03.23,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们开始吧
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.23,0:10:04.69,English,,0,0,0,, here we go .
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.23,0:10:04.69,Chinese,,0,0,0,,走
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.32,0:10:13.99,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Now the rope still seems to be pretty straight.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.32,0:10:13.99,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] 现在这绳子看起来还是停止的诶
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.99,0:10:15.68,English,,0,0,0,,I think it's because the flag
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.68,0:10:17.92,English,,0,0,0,,isn't actually adding much drag.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.99,0:10:17.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我想这是因为这旗子还不会（对绳子）增加很足够的拉力的原因
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.35,0:10:21.35,English,,0,0,0,,Still looks pretty crazy, interestingly.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.35,0:10:21.35,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但有意思的是，这还是看起来挺疯狂的
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.35,0:10:26.63,English,,0,0,0,,So, we decided to add a small parachute to the end of the rope.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.35,0:10:26.63,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以，我们决定去在绳子的尾端加一个小得降落伞
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.63,0:10:28.61,English,,0,0,0,,All right, let's try it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.63,0:10:28.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,好了，我们来试一下
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.61,0:10:30.46,English,,0,0,0,,The concern here was that the parachute
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.46,0:10:33.21,English,,0,0,0,,could get flipped up into the rotors during deployment.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.61,0:10:33.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这样做的风险就是这个小降落伞有可能在部署的时候滑到马达里面
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.21,0:10:36.17,English,,0,0,0,,So, we bundled the shoot up into a backpack.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.21,0:10:36.17,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以，我们将这个伞打包了起来
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.03,0:10:41.38,English,,0,0,0,,- [Craig] Very nicely done.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.03,0:10:41.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- [Craig] 做得很棒
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.38,0:10:43.07,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Does it deploy more than that?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.38,0:10:43.07,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] 这样做有让拉力增加吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.07,0:10:44.87,English,,0,0,0,,- [Craig] No, but once we start moving,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.87,0:10:47.21,English,,0,0,0,,its gonna grab a lot of air.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.07,0:10:47.21,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- [Craig] 没有，但是一旦我们开始移动，它就将抓住很多的空气
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.40,0:10:52.61,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Now, with the parachute at the end of the rope,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.40,0:10:52.61,Chinese,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] 现在，我们在绳子尾部加了个降落伞之后
Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.61,0:10:55.89,English,,0,0,0,,it makes a J shape, which is answer C.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.61,0:10:55.89,Chinese,,0,0,0,,绳子就变成了J形，也就是答案C的形状
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.94,0:10:59.53,English,,0,0,0,,With extra air resistance at the end of the rope,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.94,0:10:59.53,Chinese,,0,0,0,,随着更多的空气阻力加在绳子的尾端
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.53,0:11:03.62,English,,0,0,0,,but not much weight, the tension has to be virtually horizontal.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.53,0:11:03.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但（因为在这个点）重力并不是很大 ，（绳子的）张力方向就需要相当接近水平方向
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.62,0:11:05.82,English,,0,0,0,,And then as you go up the rope,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.82,0:11:08.51,English,,0,0,0,,the ratio of total air resistance to weight
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.51,0:11:10.76,English,,0,0,0,,for everything beneath decreases.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.62,0:11:10.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后随着你沿着绳子往上走，空气总阻力与飞机下面东西的重力的比值将会下降
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.76,0:11:12.89,English,,0,0,0,,So, the rope becomes more vertical
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.89,0:11:15.86,English,,0,0,0,,to balance out the increasing weight.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.76,0:11:15.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以，绳子就需要变得更垂直来平衡那不断增大的重力
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.86,0:11:17.67,English,,0,0,0,,So, depending on what's on the end of the rope,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.67,0:11:21.33,English,,0,0,0,,you could get answers B , C or D.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.86,0:11:21.33,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以根据在绳子尾部有的东西，你可以得到答案的B、C或者D
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.55,0:11:26.42,English,,0,0,0,,Now, if you enjoyed this video, I bet you would also like my bullet block experiment series.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.55,0:11:26.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在，如果你喜欢这个视频，我猜你也会喜欢我的子弹块试验的系列
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.42,0:11:27.27,English,,0,0,0,,So, check it out.
