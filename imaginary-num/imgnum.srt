1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
- Mathematics began as a
way to quantify our world,
数学这一学科
2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,910
to measure land,
起源于对世界的量化
3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,480
predict the motions of planets,
and keep track of commerce.
测量土地、预测行星运动、记录交易
4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,590
Then came a problem considered impossible.
后来，一个看似无解的问题出现了
5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,450
The secret to solving
it was to separate math
而解决这个问题的关键
6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,220
from the real world, to
split algebra from geometry
就是把真实世界和代数、几何分开
7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,840
and to invent new numbers so fanciful
然后整出一种奇妙的数
8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,020
they are called imaginary.
称为虚数
9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,750
Ironically, 400 years later,
these very numbers turn up
讽刺的是，虚数在四百年后
10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,400
in the heart of our best
physical theory of the universe.
成为了世界上最美妙的物理理论的核心
11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,940
Only by abandoning math's
connection to reality
而物理世界的这一本质
12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,956
could we discover reality's true nature.
只有断开数学和现实联系才能发现
13
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,720
(light music)
（嘤乐）
14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,290
In 1494, Luca Pacioli
在 1494，达芬奇的数学老师

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,197
who is Leonardo da Vinci's
math teacher publishes
卢卡·帕丘利发布了名为

16
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:47,560
"Summa de Arithmetica,"
a comprehensive summary
"Summa de Artihmetica" 的著作

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,230
of all mathematics known in
Renaissance Italy at the time.
总结了意大利文艺复兴时期的所有数学知识

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,380
In it, there's a section on the cubic,
里面有一节记载三次方程相关的内容

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,370
any equation which today
we would write as ax cubed
也就是我们现如今写成

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,200
plus bx squared plus
cx plus d equals zero.
ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0 形式的方程

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,550
People have been trying
to find a general solution
当时的人们

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,630
to the cubic for at least 4,000 years,
已经找了 4000 年这种方程的通解

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,100
but each ancient civilization
that encountered it,
但是各个文明碰上它

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,430
the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese,
不论是巴比伦、希腊、华夏

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,740
Indians, Egyptians, and Persians,
印度、希腊还是波斯文明

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,380
they all came up empty-handed.
都对此束手无策

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,990
Pacioli's conclusion is that a solution
帕丘利对此的总结是

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,410
to the cubic equation is impossible.
三次方程没有通解

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,370
Now, this should be at
least a little surprising,
这种想法或许有些让人意外

30
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,130
since without the X cubed term,
因为去掉三次项

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,200
the equation is simply a quadratic.
这就只是个二次方程

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,310
And many ancient civilizations
而许多古代文明

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,620
had solved quadratics
thousands of years earlier.
几千年前就会解二次方程了

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,610
Today, anyone who's passed eighth grade
而在现如今

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,260
knows the general solution.
一个初二的学生都知道通解是

36
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,340
It's minus b plus minus
root b squared minus four ac
(-b ± √(b^2-4ac))/2a

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,170
all over two a.

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,250
But most people just plug
and chug into this formula
但是许多人只是会套这个公式

39
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,840
completely oblivious to the geometry
而完全忽略了古代数学家推导时

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,320
that ancient mathematicians
used to derive it.
背后运用的几何

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,080
You know, back in those days,
因为在那时候

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,810
mathematics wasn't
written down in equations.
数学家不用式子

43
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,220
It was written with words and pictures.
而是用文字和图像描述

44
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,053
Take, for example,
例如 x^2+26x=27

45
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:03,050
the equation x squared plus 26x equals 27.

46
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,480
Ancient mathematicians would
think of the x squared term
古代的数学家

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,980
like a literal square
with sides of length x.
把 x^2 当作一个边长为 x 的正方形

48
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,670
And then 26x,
而 26x 则是一个

49
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,010
well, that would be a rectangle
with one side of length 26
一边长为 26

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,780
and the other side of length x,
另一边长为 x 的矩形

51
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,430
and these two areas together add to 27.
这俩的面积和为 27

52
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,880
So how do we figure out what x is?
那怎么求出 x 呢？

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Well, we can take this 26x
rectangle and cut it in half.
我们把这个 26x 的矩形切成两半

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,230
So now I have two 13x rectangles
and I can position them
就得到了两个 13x 的矩形

55
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,420
so the new shape I create
is almost a square,
然后我把它摆成这样

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,250
It's just missing this section down here.
就是少了一块的正方形

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,160
But I know the dimensions of this section.
但是我知道少的这块的尺寸

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,450
It's just 13 by 13.
是 13 x 13

59
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,410
So I can complete the square by adding in
那我就可以给它补上这样一个

60
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,970
a 13 by 13 square.
13 x 13 的正方形

61
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,860
Now, since I've added 13-squared
那现在我在式子左边多了 13^2

62
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,450
or 169 to the left-hand
side of the equation,
也就是 169

63
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,480
I also have to add 169
我要在式子右边也多 169

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,980
to the right-hand side of the equation

65
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,670
to maintain the equality.
才能保持两边相等

66
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,640
So now I have this larger square
现在我的大正方形

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,917
with sides of length X plus
13, and it is equal to 196.
边长是 (13+x)，面积是 196

68
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,700
Now the square root of 196 is 14.
196 开方得 14

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,330
So I know that the sides of
this square have length 14,
所以我就知道这个正方形边长是 14

70
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,820
which means X is equal to one.
也就意味着 X=1

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,870
Now this is a great visual way

72
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,870
to solve a quadratic equation,
but it isn't complete.

73
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,080
I mean, if you look at
our original equation,

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,820
x equals one is a solution.

75
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,960
But so is negative 27.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,620
For thousands of years,
mathematicians were oblivious

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,430
to the negative solutions
to their equations

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,020
because they were dealing
with things in the real world,

79
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,130
lengths and areas and volumes.

80
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,650
I mean, what would it
mean to have a square

81
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,590
with sides of length negative 27?

82
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,080
That just doesn't make any sense.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,360
So for those mathematicians,
negative numbers didn't exist.

84
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
You could subtract,

85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,930
that is find the difference
between two positive quantities,

86
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,740
but you couldn't have a negative answer

87
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,630
or negative coefficients.

88
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,960
Mathematicians were so
averse to negative numbers

89
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,540
that there was no single
quadratic equation.

90
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,880
Instead, there were six different versions

91
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,820
arranged so that the coefficients
were always positive.

92
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,350
The same approach was
taken with the cubic.

93
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,750
In the 11th century, Persian
mathematician Omar Khayyam

94
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,800
identified 19 different cubic equations,

95
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,610
again, keeping all coefficients positive.

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,680
He found numerical
solutions to some of them

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,770
by considering the
intersections of shapes,

98
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,960
like hyperbolas and circles,

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,210
but he fell short of his ultimate goal,

100
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,510
a general solution to the cubic.

101
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,100
He wrote, "Maybe one of
those who will come after us

102
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,490
will succeed in finding it."

103
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,230
400 years later and 4,000 kilometers away,

104
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,550
the solution begins to take shape.

105
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,090
Scipione del Ferro is
a mathematics professor

106
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,653
at the University of Bologna.

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,280
Sometime around 1510,

108
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,610
he finds a method to reliably
solve depressed cubics.

109
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,680
These are a subset of cubic equations

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,140
with no X squared term.

111
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,210
So what does he do after solving a problem

112
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,370
that has stumped
mathematicians from millennia?

113
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,890
One considered impossible

114
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,283
by Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher?

115
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,100
He tells no one.

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,450
See, being a mathematician
in the 1500s is hard.

117
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,280
Your job is constantly under threat

118
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,220
from other mathematicians
who can show up at any time

119
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,460
and challenge you for your position.

120
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,110
You can think of it like a math duel.

121
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,140
Each participant submits a
set of questions to the other,

122
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,010
and the person who solves
the most questions correctly

123
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,293
gets the job while the loser
suffers public humiliation.

124
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,960
As far as del Ferro knows,

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,260
no one else in the world can
solve the depressed cubic.

126
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,500
So by keeping his solutions secret,

127
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,520
he guarantees his own job security.

128
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,580
For nearly two decades,
del Ferro keeps his secret.

129
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,050
Only on his deathbed in 1526

130
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,237
does he let it slip to
his student Antonio Fior.

131
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:16,100
Fior is not as talented a
mathematician as his mentor,

132
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,380
but he is young and ambitious.

133
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,680
And after del Ferro's death,

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,120
he boasts about his own
mathematical prowess

135
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,190
and specifically, his ability
to solve the depressed cubic.

136
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,486
On February 12, 1535,

137
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:32,360
Fior challenges mathematician
Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia

138
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,110
who has recently moved to
Fior's hometown of Venice.

139
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,580
Niccolo Fontana is no
stranger to adversity.

140
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,870
As a kid, his face was cut
open by a French soldier,

141
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,770
leaving him with a stutter.

142
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,690
That's why he's known as Tartaglia,

143
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,260
which means stutterer in Italian.

144
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,630
Growing up in poverty, Tartaglia
is largely self-taught.

145
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,910
He claws his way up
through Italian society

146
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,740
to become a respected mathematician.

147
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,980
Now, all of that is at stake.

148
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,450
As is the custom, in the
challenge Tartaglia gives

149
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,830
a very discernment of 30 problems to Fior.

150
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,630
Fior gives 30 problems to Tartaglia,

151
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,093
all of which are depressed cubics.

152
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,810
Each mathematician has 40 days

153
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,369
to solve the 30 problems
they've been given.

154
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:21,250
Fior can't solve a single problem.

155
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,800
Tartaglia solves all 30
of Fior's depressed cubics

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
in just two hours.

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,360
It seems Fior's boastfulness
was his undoing.

158
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,820
Before the challenge
came, Tartaglia learns

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,130
that Fior's claimed to have
solved the depressed cubic,

160
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,617
but he's skeptical.

161
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,110
"I did not deem him capable

162
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,230
of finding such a rule on
his own," Tartaglia writes.

163
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,020
But word was that a great mathematician

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,710
had revealed the secret to Fior,
which seems more plausible.

165
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,820
So with the knowledge

166
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,090
that a solution to the cubic is possible,

167
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,170
and with his livelihood on the line,

168
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,070
Tartaglia sets about solving
the depressed cubic himself.

169
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,600
To do it, he extends the idea

170
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,610
of completing the square
into three dimensions.

171
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,090
Take the equation x cubed
plus nine x equals 26.

172
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,090
You can think of x cubed
as the volume of a cube

173
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,860
with sides of length x.

174
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,540
And if you add a volume
of nine x, you get 26.

175
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,460
So just like with completing the square,

176
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,440
we need to add onto the cube

177
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,690
to increase its volume by nine x.

178
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,270
Imagine extending three sides
of this cube out a distance y,

179
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,920
creating a new, larger cube
with sides of length, call it z.

180
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,680
z is just x plus y.

181
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,900
The original cube has been padded out

182
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,200
and we can break up the additional
volume into seven shapes.

183
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,220
There are three rectangular prisms

184
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,710
with dimensions of x by x by y,

185
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,700
and another three narrower prisms

186
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,820
with dimensions of x by y by y,

187
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,890
plus there's a cube with a volume y cubed.

188
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,080
Tartaglia rearranges the
six rectangular prisms

189
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,720
into one block.

190
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,010
One side has length three y,

191
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,280
the other has a length
x plus y, which is z,

192
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,400
and the height is x.

193
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,840
So the volume of this shape

194
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,490
is its base, three yz times its height, x.

195
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,010
And Tartaglia realizes this
volume can perfectly represent

196
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,180
the nine x term in the equation,

197
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,830
if its base is equal to nine.

198
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,057
So he sets three yz equals nine.

199
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:26,230
Putting the cube back together,

200
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,380
you find we're missing the
one small y cubed block,

201
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,090
so we can complete the cube

202
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,340
by adding y cubed to both
sides of the equation.

203
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,320
Now we have z cubed, the
complete larger cube,

204
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,650
equals 26 plus y cubed.

205
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,900
We have two equations and two unknowns.

206
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,520
Solving the first equation for z

207
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,140
and substituting into the second,

208
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,830
we get y to the six plus
26 y cubed equals 27.

209
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,670
At first glance, it seems
like we're now worse off

210
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,770
than when we started.

211
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,890
The variable is now raised
to the power of six,

212
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,490
instead of just three.

213
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,990
However, if you think of
y cubed as a new variable,

214
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,040
the equation is actually a quadratic,

215
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,780
the same quadratic that we
solved by completing the square.

216
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,330
So we know y cubed equals one,

217
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,340
which means y equals one,
and z equals three over y,

218
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,900
so z is three.

219
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,963
And since x plus y equals
z, x must be equal to two,

220
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,440
which is indeed, a solution
to the original equation.

221
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
And with that,

222
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,030
Tartaglia becomes the
second human on the planet

223
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,270
to solve the depressed cubic.

224
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,590
To save himself the work of
going through the geometry

225
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,840
for each new cubic he encounters,

226
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,880
Tartaglia summarizes his
method in an algorithm,

227
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,680
a set of instructions.

228
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,350
He writes this down not
as a set of equations

229
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,390
like we would today.

230
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,440
Modern algebraic notation wouldn't exist

231
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,913
for another hundred years,
but instead, as a poem.

232
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:55,830
Tartaglia's victory makes
him something of a celebrity.

233
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,760
Mathematicians are desperate to learn

234
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,170
how he solved the cubic,

235
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,640
especially Gerolamo Cardano,
a polymath based in Milan.

236
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,310
As you can guess, Tartaglia
will have none of it.

237
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,550
He refuses to reveal

238
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,310
even a single question
from the competition.

239
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,290
But Cardano is persistent.

240
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,420
He writes a series of
letters that alternate

241
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,830
between flattery and aggressive attacks.

242
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,110
Eventually with the
promise of an introduction

243
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,800
to his wealthy benefactor,

244
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,490
Cardono manages to lure
Tartaglia to Milan.

245
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,300
And there on March 25, 1539
Tartaglia reveals his method,

246
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,210
but only after forcing
Cardono to swear a solemn oath

247
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,940
not to tell anyone the method,

248
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,670
not to publish it, and to
write it only in cipher.

249
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,240
Quote, "So that after my death,

250
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,300
no one shall be able to understand it."

251
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,640
Cardono is delighted and
immediately starts playing around

252
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,470
with Tartaglia's algorithm.

253
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,740
But he has a loftier goal in mind,

254
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,930
a solution to the full cubic equation,

255
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,050
including the x squared term.

256
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,760
And amazingly, he discovers it.

257
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,700
If you substitute for x,

258
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,060
x minus b over three a,

259
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,270
then all the X squared terms cancel out.

260
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,200
This is the way to turn
any general cubic equation

261
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,880
into a depressed cubic,

262
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,000
which can then be solved
by Tartaglia's formula.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,570
Cardano is so excited to
have solved the problem

264
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,390
that stumped the best mathematicians
for thousands of years,

265
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,280
he wants to publish it.

266
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,210
Unlike his peers,

267
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,120
Cardano has no need to
keep the solution a secret.

268
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,620
He makes his living
not as a mathematician,

269
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,490
but as a physician and
famous intellectual.

270
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,510
For him, the credit is more
valuable than the secret.

271
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,100
The only problem is the
oath he swore to Tartaglia

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,460
who won't let him break it.

273
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,730
And you might think this
would be the end of it.

274
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,790
But in 1542, Cardano travels to Bologna

275
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,650
and there he visits a mathematician

276
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,780
who just happens to be the son-in-law

277
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,700
of one Scipione del Ferro,
the man who on his deathbed,

278
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,373
gave the solution to the
depressed cubic to Antonio Fior.

279
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:02,750
Cardano finds the solution
in del Ferro's old notebook,

280
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,840
which is shared with him during the visit.

281
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,020
This solution predates
Tartaglia's by decades.

282
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,750
So now, as Cardano sees it,

283
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,960
he can publish the full
solution to the cubic

284
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,500
without violating his oath to Tartaglia.

285
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,470
Three years later,

286
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,430
Cardano publishes "Ars
Magna," The Great Art,

287
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,897
an updated compendium of mathematics.

288
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:25,027
"Written in five years, may
it last for five hundred."

289
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,830
Cardano writes a chapter
with a unique geometric proof

290
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,250
for each of the 13 arrangements
of the cubic equation.

291
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,280
Although he acknowledges

292
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,590
the contributions of
Tartaglia, del Ferro and Fior,

293
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,950
Tartaglia is displeased, to say the least.

294
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,830
He writes insulting letters to Cardano,

295
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,250
and CC's a good fraction of
the mathematics community.

296
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,320
And he has a point.

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,590
To this day, the general
solution to the cubic

298
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,780
is often called Cardano's method.

299
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,900
But "Ars Magna" is a
phenomenal achievement.

300
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,540
It pushes geometrical reasoning
to its very breaking point.

301
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,010
Literally.

302
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,070
While Cardano is writing "Ars Magna "

303
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,170
he comes across some cubic equations

304
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,270
that can't easily be
solved in the usual way,

305
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,910
like x cubed equals 15x plus four.

306
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,580
Plugging this into the
algorithm yields a solution

307
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,890
that contains the square
roots of negative numbers.

308
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,220
Cardano asks Tartaglia about the case,

309
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,270
but he evades and implies Cardano

310
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,450
is just not clever enough
to use his formula properly.

311
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,923
The reality is Tartaglia has
no idea what to do either.

312
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,820
Cardano walks back through
the geometric derivation

313
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,950
of a similar problem to see
exactly what goes wrong.

314
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,690
While the 3D cube slicing and
rearrangement works just fine,

315
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,360
the final quadratic
completing the square step

316
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,150
leads to a geometric paradox.

317
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,530
Cardano finds part of a square
that must have an area of 30,

318
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,660
but also sides of length five.

319
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,600
Since the full square has an area of 25,

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,940
to complete the square,

321
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,460
Cardano has to somehow add negative area.

322
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,240
That is where the square
roots of negatives come from,

323
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,520
the idea of negative area.

324
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,730
Now, this isn't the first time

325
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,150
square roots of negatives
show up in mathematics.

326
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,670
In fact, earlier in "Ars
Magnae" is this problem.

327
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,960
Find two numbers that add
to 10 and multiply to 40.

328
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,500
You can combine these
equations into the quadratic

329
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,550
X squared plus 40 equals 10 X.

330
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,130
But if you plug this into
the quadratic formula,

331
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,830
the solutions contain the
square roots of negatives.

332
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,630
The obvious conclusion is
that a solution doesn't exist,

333
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,370
which you can verify by looking
at the original problem.

334
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,330
There are no two real numbers,

335
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,823
which add to 10 and multiply to 40.

336
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,840
So mathematicians understood

337
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
square roots of negative numbers

338
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,310
were maths way of telling
you there is no solution.

339
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,280
But this cubic equation is different.

340
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,710
With the little guessing and checking,

341
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,700
you can find that x
equals four is a solution.

342
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,830
So why doesn't the approach
that works for all other cubics

343
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,520
find the perfectly reasonable
solution to this one?

344
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,970
Unable to see a way forward,

345
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,520
Cardano avoids this case in "Ars Magna"

346
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,930
saying the idea of the
square root of negatives

347
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,363
"is as subtle as it is useless".

348
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,350
But around 10 years later,
the Italian engineer

349
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,840
Rafael Bombelli picks up
where Cardano left off.

350
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,650
Undeterred by the square
roots of negatives

351
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,870
and the impossible geometry they imply,

352
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,520
he wants to find a way through
the mess to the solution.

353
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Observing that the
square root of a negative

354
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,370
"cannot be called either
positive or negative",

355
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,100
he lets it be its own new type of number.

356
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,670
Bombelli assumes the two
terms in Cardano's solution

357
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,920
can be represented as some combination

358
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,590
of an ordinary number and
this new type of number,

359
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,130
which involves the square
root of negative one.

360
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,350
And this way, Bombelli figures out

361
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,900
that the two cube roots
in Cardano's equation

362
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,110
are equivalent to two

363
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,520
plus or minus the square
root of negative one.

364
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,060
So when he takes the final
step and adds them together,

365
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,520
the square roots cancel out,

366
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,430
leaving the correct answer, four.

367
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,080
This feels nothing short of miraculous.

368
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,010
Cardano's method does work,

369
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,370
but you have to abandon
the geometric proof

370
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,960
that generated it in the first place.

371
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,930
Negative areas, which
make no sense in reality,

372
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,350
must exist as an intermediate step

373
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,450
on the way to the solution.

374
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,030
Over the next hundred years,
modern mathematics takes shape.

375
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,200
In the 1600s, Francois Viete

376
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,440
introduces the modern
symbolic notation for algebra,

377
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,130
ending the millennia-long tradition

378
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,450
of math problems as drawings
and wordy descriptions.

379
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,110
Geometry is no longer the source of truth.

380
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,870
Rene Descartes makes heavy use

381
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,410
of the square roots of negatives,

382
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,700
popularizing them as a result.

383
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,690
And while he recognizes their utility,

384
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,330
he calls them imaginary
numbers, a name that sticks,

385
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,740
which is why Euler later
introduces the letter i

386
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,330
to represent the square
root of negative one.

387
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,230
When combined with regular numbers,

388
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,900
they form complex numbers.

389
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,670
The cubic led to the
invention of these new numbers

390
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,830
and liberated algebra from geometry.

391
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,950
By letting go

392
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,410
of what seems like the best
description of reality,

393
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,060
the geometry you can see and touch,

394
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,810
you get a much more powerful
and complete mathematics

395
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,130
that can solve real problems.

396
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,770
And it turns out the cubic
is just the beginning.

397
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,950
In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger is
searching for a wave equation

398
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,410
that governs the behavior
of quantum particles

399
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,750
building on de Broglie's insight

400
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,190
that matter consists of waves.

401
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,500
He comes up with one of the most important

402
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,960
and famous equations in all of physics,

403
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,770
the Schrödinger equation.

404
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,770
And featured prominently within it is i,

405
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,220
the square root of negative one.

406
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,890
While mathematicians have grown accustomed

407
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,740
to imaginary numbers, physicists have not

408
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,560
and are uncomfortable seeing it show up

409
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,500
in such a fundamental theory.

410
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,277
Schrödinger himself writes

411
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:54,690
"What is unpleasant here,

412
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,370
and indeed directly to be objected to,

413
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,640
is the use of complex numbers.

414
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,100
The wave function Psi

415
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,760
is surely fundamentally a real function."

416
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,740
This seems like a fair objection,

417
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,730
so why does an imaginary number

418
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,010
that first appeared in
the solution to the cubic

419
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,560
turn up in fundamental physics?

420
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,490
Well, it's because of
some unique properties

421
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,510
of imaginary numbers.

422
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,120
Imaginary numbers exist on
a dimension perpendicular

423
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,920
to the real number line.

424
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,160
Together, they form the complex plane.

425
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,800
Watch what happens when we
repeatedly multiply by i.

426
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,330
Starting with one.

427
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,810
One times i is i,

428
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,100
i times i is negative one, by definition.

429
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,010
Negative one times i is negative i,

430
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,630
and negative i times i is one.

431
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,050
We've come back to where we started,

432
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,740
and if we keep multiplying by i,

433
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,250
the point will keep rotating around.

434
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,300
So when you're multiplying by i,

435
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,830
what you're really doing is rotating

436
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,800
by 90 degrees in the complex plane.

437
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,300
Now, there is a function that
repeatedly multiplies by i

438
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,420
as you go down the X-axis.

439
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,460
And that is e to the ix.

440
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,560
It creates a spiral by
essentially spreading out

441
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,070
these rotations all along the X-axis.

442
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,030
If you look at the real
part of the spiral,

443
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,630
it's a cosine wave.

444
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,120
And if you look at the imaginary
part, it's a sine wave.

445
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,160
The two quintessential
functions that describe waves

446
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,133
are both contained in e to the ix.

447
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,770
So when Schrodinger goes to
write down a wave equation,

448
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,750
he naturally assumes that
the solutions to his equation

449
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,860
will look something like e to the ix,

450
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,420
specifically e to the ikx minus omega t.

451
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,450
You might wonder why he
would use that formulation

452
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,670
and not just a simple sine wave,

453
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,440
but the exponential has
some useful properties.

454
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,890
If you take the derivative with
respect to position or time,

455
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,560
that derivative is proportional

456
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,790
to the original function itself.

457
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,610
And that's not true if
you use the sine function

458
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,760
whose derivative is cosine.

459
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,640
Plus, since the Schrodinger
equation is linear,

460
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,390
you can add together an
arbitrary number of solutions

461
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,310
of this form, creating any
sort of wave shape you like,

462
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,670
and it too, will be a solution
to Schrodinger's equation.

463
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,437
The physicist Freeman Dyson later writes,

464
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,500
"Schrödinger put the
square root of minus one

465
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,810
into the equation, and
suddenly it made sense.

466
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,190
Suddenly it became a wave equation

467
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,340
instead of a heat conduction equation.

468
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,640
And Schrodinger found to his delight

469
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,160
that the equation has solutions

470
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,310
corresponding to the quantized orbits

471
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,560
in the Bohr model of the atom.

472
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,640
It turns out that the Schrodinger equation

473
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,130
describes correctly everything we know

474
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,290
about the behavior of atoms.

475
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,600
It is the basis of all of
chemistry and most of physics.

476
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
And that square root of minus one

477
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,600
means that nature works
with complex numbers

478
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,340
and not with real numbers.

479
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,520
This discovery came as
a complete surprise,

480
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,980
to Schrodinger as well
as to everybody else."

481
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,630
So imaginary numbers

482
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,440
discovered as a quirky, intermediate step

483
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,830
on the way to solving the cubic
turn out to be fundamental

484
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,230
to our description of reality.

485
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,530
Only by giving up maths
connection to reality

486
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,980
could it guide us to a deeper truth

487
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,453
about the way the universe works.

488
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,370
Not gonna lie, I learned a
ton while making this video,

489
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,060
because I really had to
engage with some ideas

490
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,800
that I was already familiar with.

491
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,890
And that is exactly what
happens with Brilliant,

492
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,680
the sponsor of this video.

493
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,750
Brilliant is a website
and app that teaches you

494
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,630
all kinds of STEM concepts,

495
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,750
from geometry to quantum mechanics.

496
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,680
And you learn by doing.

497
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,930
They use interactivity to
bring your understanding

498
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,100
to the next level.

499
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,250
Like calculus?

500
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,260
No problem.

501
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,420
It's way more fun

502
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,240
when you work through
the material yourself

503
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,670
and get to manipulate it visually.

504
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,740
Check out these Surfaces of Revolution,

505
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,050
a clear demonstration of how you can use

506
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,170
an integral to find volume.

507
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,030
The problems are carefully curated

508
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,200
to increase in difficulty as you go.

509
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,550
And if you get stuck, there
is always a helpful hint.

510
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,020
If this video has whetted your
appetite for complex numbers,

511
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,300
they have an awesome
course on that subject

512
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,060
from the Mandelbrot
set to Euler's formula.

513
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,680
