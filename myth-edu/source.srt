19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,090
well, then they'll learn better.

这个东西是要接触的 你必须得亲自去做才能学到 [REVIEW: "it"?]

36
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,530
- I want to try something with you, a little experiment.

38
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,400
and I don't want you to say anything while you're looking at them,
你看的时候不要说话

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,660
and at the end of the 10 you tell me how many you can remember.
看完了以后把记得的告诉我

40

- 可以吗
- 可

42
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,159
- Okay.
- 嗯

43
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,510
- Now, learning styles make intuitive sense because we know everyone is different.
每个人都是独特的 这让我们感觉 大家自然而然会有不同的学习风格

44
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,960
Some people have better spacial reasoning.

48
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,430

49
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,180
of thought in the recent Western tradition is,

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,850
we're all unique, we're all different.
我们每个人都是独特、不同的

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,157
And so you don't want to say, like, everybody learns the same way.
所以没必要每个人都用同一种方式来学习

52
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:09,190
That sort of conflicts with our feelings about what it means to be human.
学习方式完全一致与人类的意义相冲突

53
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,500
- So doesn't it make sense that
那这样说的话

54
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,390
people should learn better in their own preferred learning style?
人们以自己的学习方式学习效果更好？

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,720
Well, teachers certainly seem to think so.
啊，老师们当然这么想

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,610
A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and
英国和荷兰 400 名左右的教师里

57
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,750
the Netherlands found that over 90% believed that

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,340
individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style.
学生以他们的学习风格接收信息学得更快

59
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,000
- Just like every professor has a different style of teaching,
- 教授有不同的教学方式

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
you have a different style of learning.

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000

Johnathan 发现他理解课堂内容更快了 听课更专注了

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,382
so he might be a visual learner.
因此他可能是个视觉学习者

64
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:41,610
- Can you tell me what that means to you?
你能说一下作为一个视觉学习者

65
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,360
Like, what does it mean to be a visual learner?
这对你来说有什么样的意义吗

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,620
- To me it means that... for me, to learn something,
- 对我来说 这意味着我学东西的时候

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,250
sometimes you need to draw it or I need to write it down
有时得要画出来或者写下来

68
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,080
or I need to see a picture or a movie.
或者看图像、影片

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,000
- For example, science classes, I get bored easily just listening
例如科学课上听着听着我就睡着了

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,140
and I think it's more interesting for me to actually be able to do it.
我觉得  要是能让我上手做的话  我会更喜欢这个课

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,750
- How do you know that you're a visual learner?

72
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,253
- I don't, I just assumed.
- 我没法证明  我只是猜的

73
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,520
- To take advantage of learning styles then teachers need to do two things.
- 要把学生学习风格的优势运用起来 老师要做两件事

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,120
First, identify the learning style of each of their students.
首先他们要弄清楚他们各个学生的学习风格

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,550
And second, teach each student in accordance with their learning style.
然后根据各个学生的学习风格来教学

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,200
On the VARK website it says,
在 VARK 的网站上

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
once you know about VARK, its power to explain things will be a revelation.
它说你一旦知道了这东西 你便知道了如何教别人的惊天秘密

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,310
But before you take an online learning styles quiz,
但是在你跑去测你的学习风格之前

79
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,060
it's a good idea to ask, do learning styles even exist?
想想看 学习风格真的存在吗？

80
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,260
I mean, do you have one?
你有学习风格吗？

81
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,320
And if you're taught in accordance with it, would you learn better?
如果有人按着你的学习风格教你 你会学得更好吗

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,363
Well, you could test this by running a randomized control trial
这个东西可以通过一个控制变量的随机试验来检验

83
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,620
where first you would identify learners
首先你先找到一批的不同学习风格的学习者

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,800
with at least two different learning styles, say visual and auditory
假设他们的学习风格有视觉和听觉的

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,840
and then randomly assign learners to one of two educational presentations,
然后把他们随机分到两个课堂里

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,870
one visual, one auditory.
一个视觉教学，一个听觉教学

87
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,700
So for half of the students, the experience will match their learning style
那这样一半的学生会以他们的学习方式学习

88
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,000
and for the other half it won't.
另外一半则不会

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,930
And then you give everyone the same test.
在此之后给他们一份测试题

90
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,350
If the learning style hypothesis is correct,
如果学习风格的假说是对的

91
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,000
the results should show better performance when the presentation
在匹配自身学习风格的课堂里  上课的学生

92
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,613
matches the learning style than when they're mismatched.
应该考得比那些风格不匹配的学生要好

93
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,090
I tried a very unscientific version of this experiment on the street.
我在大街上很不严谨地进行了一下这个实验

94
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,637
For some people, I matched their learning style
对于一部分人，我展示这些东西的方式和他们的学习风格一致

95
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:21,149
so I showed visual learners pictures of 10 items,
例如我给（一部分）视觉学习者看了十个事物的图像

96
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,819
but for other visual learners I read out the items instead.
但是对于另一部分的视觉学习者 我则是把这些东西读出来

97
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:29,810
Bell, penguin, sun.

but because they employed a memory strategy.
而是因为他们用了记忆的技巧

132
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:36,047
- So as you were showing I was making an order in my head.
- 你在给我看的时候我脑内就形成了一个顺序

133
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,250
So as I saw more I would just add it to the list
新加进来一个我就把它加到列表里

134
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,240
and I was repeating the list as I was looking at them
我回答的时候就会像把这个列表念出来一样

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
so I could just say it out loud.
所以就挺轻松的

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,580
- Did you try a strategy while you were looking at those pictures?
- 你记忆的时候用了什么特殊技巧吗

137
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,580
- Yeah, yeah.
- 是

138
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,263
So I guess I tried creating a story
我把它们连成了一个故事

139
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,660
'cause it's easier to remember a story than just individual objects.
这样记起来比这些零散的要轻松

140
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,190
So I tried to tie it all into one story.
所以我刚刚尝试把它串成故事

141
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,370
- This is all obviously anecdotal evidence,
当然这不是太正经的依据了

142
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,220
but rigorous studies like the one I outlined have been conducted.
但是实际上类似的研究已经做过了

143
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,790
For example, one looked at visualizers versus verbalizers
他研究的不是视觉或者听觉学习者

144
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,966
instead of visual versus auditory learners.
而是图形学习者和文字学习者

145
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,600
The study was computer-based,
这是一个基于计算机的测试

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,500
so first students' learning styles were assessed using questions like,
首先这些学生会回答一些问题

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,440
would you rather read a paragraph or see a diagram describing an atom?
例如你喜欢看原子的文字还是示意图的描述

148
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
The researchers also provided some challenging explanations
研究者还整了一些复杂的介绍

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,110
with two buttons, visual help or verbal help.
配上“图形解说”和“文字解说”的两个按钮

150
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,290
The visual one played a short animation
图形解说会放一个小动画

151
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,670
whereas the verbal help gave a written explanation.
文字解说则会弹出一段文字

152
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,700
From these measures combined,
通过这些方式

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,280
the researchers categorized the students as either visualizers or verbalizers
研究者将这些学生分成了视觉和文字学习者两类

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,470
and then the students were randomly assigned
然后将他们随机分配到一个电子电路课堂

155
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,220
to go through a text-based or picture-based lesson on electronics.
这个课堂有文字和图像两种授课方式

156
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,560
When a student hovered their mouse over key words 
当学生把指针悬停在关键词上时

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,810
in the lesson in the text-based group, a definition and clarification came up.
文字授课方式的课堂将显示它的定义和解释

158
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,130
But in the picture group,
而图像授课方式的课堂

159
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,780
an annotated diagram was shown instead.
则是显示一个示意图

160
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,710
And after the lesson, the students did a test to assess their learning.
上完课后，测试者发给学生一套测试题来检验学习情况

161
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,000
The students whose preferred learning style matched their instruction
测试结果表明学习的方式与学习风格一致的学生

162
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,200
performed no better on the tests than those whose instruction was mismatched.
并没有比不一致的好

163
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,250
The researchers ran the test again with 61 non-college-educated adults
测试者还在 61 个没受过大学教育的学生上做了同样的测试

164
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,364
and found exactly the same result.
结果是一致的

165
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,886
But learning styles are a preference
但是  学习风格是种「偏好」

166
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,710
so how strongly do learners stick to their preference?
那么  学生们的偏好固定吗

167
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,630
Well, in a 2018 study during the first week of semester,
在 2018 年的一项研究中  在学期伊始

168
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,000
over 400 students at a university in Indiana completed the VARK questionnaire
印第安纳州一所大学的400多名学生  填写了VARK调查问卷

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,100
and they were classified according to their learning style.
他们根据问卷得出的学习方法  被分为了四大组

170
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,320
Then at the end of the semester
到了学期结束时

171
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,374
the same students completed a study strategy questionnaire.
这帮学生又填写了实际学习策略的调查问卷

172
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:35,780
So how did they actually study during the term?
他们在这个学期实际上是怎么学的

173
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,200
Well, an overwhelming majority of students used study strategies
占压倒性多数的学生

174
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,580
which were supposedly incompatible with their learning style,
使用的学习策略反而并不符合自身的学习风格

175
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,118
and the minority of students who did
而极少数使用了相符策略的学生

176
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:48,553
did not perform significantly differently on the assessments in the course.
在课程的考试中并没有与前者产生显著差异

177
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:52,000
The visual auditory reading-writing, kinesthetic or VARK model
视觉、听觉、读写、动手模型（即 VARK 模型）

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,040
came about from Neil Fleming, a school inspector in New Zealand.
由新西兰的一位学校督学——尼尔・佛莱明提出

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,390
Describing the origins of VARK he says,
他是这样描述他如何发明 VARK 的

180
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,000
I was puzzled when I observed excellent teachers who did not reach some learners
让我很困惑的是  我观察到最厉害的老师也有教不会的学生

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,220
and poor teachers who did.
但最差的老师反而能教会这些学生

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,360
I decided to try to solve this puzzle.
我想试试去解决这一问题

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,540
There are, of course, many reasons for what I observed.
当然  我观察到了不少缘由

184
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,150
But one topic that seemed to hold some magic, some explanatory power,
但我觉得有一个原因是最有说服力的

185
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,850
was preferred modes of learning, modal preferences.
那就是「偏好的学习模式」或称「典型偏好」

186
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,240
And thus, VARK was born.
VARK 因此而生

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,980
There was no study that revealed students naturally cluster into four distinct groups.
原来  研究并没有证明学生会天然的分成四个组别

188
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,720
Just some magic that might explain

189
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,930
why some teachers can reach students while others can't.

190
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,430
But how can this be?

191
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,650
If we accept that some people are more skilled
如果我们认可这种观点  有些人相对更擅长处理、记忆某几类因素  比如图像或声音

192
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,960
at interpreting and remembering certain kinds of stimuli

193
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,659
than others like visual or auditory,

194
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,599
then why don't we see differences in learning or recall with different presentations?
为何在学习或者回忆事物的测试中  显示不出差别呢

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,480
Well, it's because what we actually want people to recall
这是因为  其实人们需要记忆的东西

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,010
is not the precise nature of the images or the pitch or quality of the sound.
并不是图像的精确性质  亦非声音的音调和质量

197
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,212
It's the meaning behind the presentations.
要记的是各种表现形式背后的「实际含义」

198
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:57,520
There are some tasks that obviously require the use of a particular modality.
有些任务必然需要使用某一类特定的表现形式

199
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,180
Learning about music, for example, should have an auditory component.
比如说  学音乐肯定依赖于声音

200
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,055
Similarly, learning about geography will involve looking at maps.
类似的  学地理肯定需要看地图

201
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:09,310
And some people will have greater aptitude to learn one task over another.
有些人天生就比别人更擅长学习某类任务

202
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,830
Someone with perfect pitch, for example,
比如说  有绝对音感的人肯定更容易记住音乐中的音调

203
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,830
will be better able to recall certain tones in music.
比如说  有绝对音感的人肯定更容易记住音乐中的音调

204
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,820
Someone with excellent visual-spatial reasoning
视觉-空间推理能力强的人  能更准确地在国家地图上定位

205
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,870
will be better at learning the locations of countries on a map.
视觉-空间推理能力强的人  能更准确地在国家地图上定位

206
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,930
But the claim of learning style theories is that
但学习风格理论宣称  这些偏好性不管学啥东西都是不变的

207
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,792
these preferences will be consistent across learning domains.
但学习风格理论宣称  这些偏好性不管学啥东西都是不变的

208
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:29,157
The person with perfect pitch should learn everything better auditorily
有绝对音感的人  碰到一切关乎声音的内容时  都应该学得更快

209
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:31,780
but that is clearly not the case.
这很明显不合道理

210
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,633
Most people will learn geography better with a map.
大部分人学好地理靠的是地图

211
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,910
Review articles of learning styles consistently conclude
专家审查了学习风格的文章后  一致得出

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,030
there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist.
尚没有显著的证据能证明学习风格真的存在

213
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,000
In a 2009 review, the researchers note,
在 2009 年的审核中  研究者指出

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,100
the contrast between the enormous popularity
学习风格论在教育界的流行  跟它缺乏可信证据的事实  形成了鲜明对比
215
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,630
of the learning styles approach within education
学习风格论在教育界的流行  跟它缺乏可信证据的事实  形成了鲜明对比
216
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,060
and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is,
学习风格论在教育界的流行  跟它缺乏可信证据的事实  形成了鲜明对比
217
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,250
in our opinion, striking and disturbing.
我们认为这很离谱  这样的现状让我们很不安
218
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,200
If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility,
要是对学生的学习风格进行分类有实际作用的话

219
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,870
it remains to be demonstrated.
我们还愿意去论证一下学习风格论

220
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,210
- What we're expecting is, if your style was honored
我们本来期望的是  在遵循了相符的学习风格的情况下

221
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,320
you're going to perform better than if
你应该比使用了相异学习风格的表现要更好

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
you had some experience that conflicted with your style.
你应该比使用了相异学习风格的表现要更好

223
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,730
And this is where we don't see any support for the learning styles theory.
我们在这一点上看不到任何支持学习风格论的证据

224
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,581
- One of the reasons many people find learning styles
人们对学习风格论如此的深信不疑

225
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,720
so convincing is because they already believe it to be true.
或许是因为他们先相信学习风格是真实存在的

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,500
For example, they might already think that they're a visual learner,
他们可能已经相信自己是视觉学习者

227
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,000
and then when a teacher shows them a diagram of, say, a bike pump
如果老师给他们展示了一份图解  比如说自行车打气筒

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
and suddenly the concept clicks,
然后学生一下子开窍了

229
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,310
well, they interpret this as evidence for their visual learning style.
他们就认为  这恰好能作为证据  印证自己是个视觉学习着

230
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,810
- You already believe that learning styles is right.
你先入为主的认为学习方法是正确的

231
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,600
When you have an experience the first thing you think is,
当你从实践中获得经验时  你第一时间先想

232
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,260
is that in some way consistent with learning styles?
它符不符合我的学习风格

233
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,830
And if it is, you don't think further.
如果符合  你就不再深入思考了

234
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,000
- When in reality that diagram
那个图解说不定只是一个对任何学习者都有帮助的优质图解

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,240
might just be a great diagram that would have helped anyone learn.
那个图解说不定只是一个对任何学习者都有帮助的优质图解


236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,230
When we already believe the world to be a certain way,
你头脑中已经给世界画了个框框（认为世界就是这样运行的）

237
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,690
then we interpret new experiences to fit with those beliefs
然后对一切新的经验  不管三七二十一就往框框里套

238
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,908
whether they actually do or not.
然后对一切新的经验  不管三七二十一就往框框里套

239
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,440
So if learning styles don't improve learning, then what does?
那么，如果学习风格对学习并无帮助，那什么才有帮助呢

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,500
Well, there's a large body of literature that supports the claim that
事实上  有大量文献支持的一个观点是

241
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,330
everyone learns better with multimodal approaches
使用多种感官形式来学习的效果会优于单一形式

242
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,980
where words and pictures are presented together
同时展示文本和图像的效果要优于只展现其中一者

243
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,600
rather than either words or pictures alone.
同时展示文本和图像的效果要优于只展现其中一者

244
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,090
Now there's gonna be words as well as the picture.
接下来  文字是和图像一起展示的

245
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,060
We're gonna see if this is any better.
看看结果会不会更好一点

246
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,500
This is known as the multimedia effect,
这种效应被称为“多媒体效应”

247
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,430
and it explains in part, at least,
它至少在一定程度上解释了

248
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,220
why videos can be such powerful tools for learning
拥有图像和旁白的视频  为什么能成为一种强大的学习工具

249
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,920
when the narration complements the visuals.
拥有图像和旁白的视频  为什么能成为一种强大的学习工具

250
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,013

在我的博士研究中我发现  在物理学入门的多媒体教学中

253
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,830
in multimedia teaching for introductory physics.
对错误概念的明确讨论是至关重要的

254
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,050
- How many is that?
- Six.
总共多少
六个

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,030
- Six, okay, that's good.
六个，不错嘛

256
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,490
- That is a whole 50% better.
这好了一半呢

257
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,948
Do you think that was easier?
你觉得这样更简单吗

258
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,980
- Yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%.
- Yeah, with the words, yeah.
- 对，百分百更简单
- 对，有了文字更简单，对

259
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,214
- Ultimately, the most important thing for learning
学习中最终极、最重要的特质

260
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:52,980
is not the way the information is presented
不是呈现信息的方式

261
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,990
but what is happening inside the learner's head.
而是学习者脑袋里有何过程

262
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,000
People learn best when they're actively thinking about the material,
人们学得最牢固的时候  是他们活跃地思考材料、

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,010
solving problems or imagining what happens if different variables change.
解决问题、或是想象不同变量的变化方式

264
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,290
I talked about how and why we learn best
我之前聊过学习的最佳方式、为什么这方式最佳

265
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,690
in my video, "The Science of Thinking" so check that out.
快去康康我之前的视频「思考的科学」

266
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,220
Now, the truth is, there are many evidence-based teaching methods that improve learning.
真相是  有许多教学方法已得到证据佐证  有助于学习

267
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,810
Learning styles is just not one of them.
但学习风格论不能算在里面

268
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,830
And it is likely, given the prevalence of the learning styles misconception
鉴于对学习风格广泛存在的误解

269
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,210
that it actually makes learning worse.
它很可能实际上会让学习效果更差

270
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,800
I mean, learning styles give teachers unnecessary things to worry about,
我的意思是  学习风格论给教师带来了不必要的担心

271
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,650
and they make some students reluctant to engage with certain types of instruction.
还导致一些学生不愿参与某些类别的教学

272
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,600
And all the time and money spent on learning styles and related training
在学习风格一脉的培训上浪费的时间和金钱

273
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,180
could be better spent on interventions that actually improve learning.
本可以更好地用于真正改善学习的措施上

274
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,200
You are not a visual learner nor an auditory learner nor a kinesthetic learner,
你并不是什么视觉、听觉、动手学习者

275
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,400
or more accurately, you are all these kinds of learner in one.
更准确地说  你是依赖于所有感官的学习者  是上面的集合体

276
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,470
The best learning experiences are those
最好的学习实践  应囊括了对同一事物的多种理解角度

277
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,620
that involve multiple different ways of understanding the same thing.
最好的学习实践  应囊括了对同一事物的多种理解角度

278
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,435
And best of all, this strategy works not just for one subset of people but for everyone.
并且最好的是  这样的策略不是对一部分人  而是对所有人都适用
