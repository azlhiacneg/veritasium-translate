1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
- Can I tell you something I'm bad at?

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,500
I am terrible at making clickbait.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,650
Up until two years ago,

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,110
my most popular video
was about a basketball

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,010
being dropped from a dam
with a bit of backspin.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,400
It takes off like a rocket and shoots out

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
way further than you'd expect.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,190
This video was embedded

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,700
on literally hundreds of news websites.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,320
And in its first week, it
got 16.3 million views,

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,200
but almost none of those views
came on the YouTube platform.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,130
Why?

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,560
Because I gave it this thumbnail

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,917
and I called it "Strange
Applications of the Magnus Effect."

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,630
This video is sponsored by KiwiCo.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,120
More about them at the end of the show.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,610
Now, I believe within YouTube,

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,240
I'm used as an example of how
not to package your video.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,880
As if to demonstrate just how bad

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,320
a title and thumbnail this is,

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,137
someone else re-uploaded the
video with the clever title,

22
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,550
"Basketball Dropped From Dam."

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,240
And within a few weeks,
that video had received

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,010
tens of millions of views on YouTube.

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,410
This is when YouTube gave
me access to ContentID.

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,560
That's the system that
allows you to earn revenue

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,890
when someone else re-uploads
your videos, which was good,

28
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,740
but I still wasn't very good at clickbait.

29
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,730
So for this video, I called in an expert.

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,650
I wanted to see your reaction face.

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,970
Can you give me like a reaction face?

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,100
Like what's a good thumbnail face?

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,150
- Oh, I got you.

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,096
This is a thumbnail face.

35
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:24,220
(Derek laughs)

36
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,285
I have like 10, I go through
the motions of like...

37
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:30,065
(Derek laughs)

38
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,060
And then we just take the best one,

39
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,560
I probably have like
500 of these just saved

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,290
and we can just Photoshop
my face on my face.

41
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,360
That way, I don't have to do it anymore.

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,460
- When I started on this
platform, some 10 years ago,

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,120
clickbait was less important.

44
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,090
Subscribers were what mattered,

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,800
because most of the views
came from the sub feed.

46
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
And videos went viral usually

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,090
by getting a lot of attention elsewhere,

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,000
like on Reddit or Facebook,

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,860
not due to the YouTube algorithm.

50
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,810
But once you had a big
video and people subscribed,

51
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,080
well, then your next video
would likely get a lot of views

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,280
from those subscribers.

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,210
So YouTube would take that popular video

54
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,420
and share it with more people.

55
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,720
And so you'd get more subscribers

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,240
in a positive feedback loop.

57
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,020
But soon, YouTube realized
that this did not create

58
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,110
the best experience for the viewer.

59
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,050
They discovered that
showing people only videos

60
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,240
from channels they were
subscribed to led to fewer clicks,

61
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,690
less watch time and less engagement

62
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,250
with the site as a whole.

63
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,250
Plus, they knew that
relying on other platforms

64
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,800
to drive traffic to viral hits was risky,

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
since those other platforms might disable

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,230
the traffic at any time.

67
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,990
So they needed to make YouTube
a destination in itself.

68
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,000
They wanted people to come to YouTube,

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,900
see videos that interested them,

70
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,620
click on at least one of them
and watch it for a while.

71
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,430
Ideally get sucked down
the YouTube rabbit hole

72
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,770
and spend hours on the site
without even noticing it.

73
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,960
The ultimate resource is people's time

74
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,620
and attention, and every platform

75
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,430
is trying to capture as
much of it as possible.

76
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,690
So, to make YouTube
this go-to destination,

77
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,420
they had decrease the
importance of subscribers,

78
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,160
make it less like a podcast app

79
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
where you only get the
shows you're subscribed to,

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,530
and more like Reddit,

81
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,260
where stuff with the most
engagement rises to the top.

82
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,430
But that necessarily meant increasing

83
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,740
the importance of clickbait.

84
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,850
Now, there seems to be a paradox
when it comes to clickbait.

85
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,130
People almost universally
claim to hate it,

86
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,850
but you also see it everywhere.

87
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,600
So why is this?

88
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,740
Well, one of the problems
is we don't all agree

89
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,390
on the definition of clickbait.

90
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,900
When I google it, the top definition is,

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,240
on the internet, content
whose main purpose

92
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,790
is to attract attention
and encourage visitors

93
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,360
to click on a link to
a particular webpage.

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,050
We could call this type I clickbait,

95
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,410
and there doesn't seem to
be anything wrong with it.

96
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,980
I mean, if you didn't
try to attract attention

97
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,280
and get people to click on your links,

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,400
then you wouldn't really
be doing your job.

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,290
But there is a second definition.

100
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,950
One that I think more people ascribe to,

101
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,410
which is something such
as a headline designed

102
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,760
to make readers want to
click on a hyperlink,

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,820
especially when the link leads to content

104
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,280
of dubious value or interest.

105
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,090
Wikipedia says, "A defining
characteristic of clickbait

106
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,980
is that it is sensationalized
or misleading."

107
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,820
And it also talks about teasers

108
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,520
that intentionally withhold information

109
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,640
to exploit the "curiosity gap."

110
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,200
They give you enough
information to make you curious,

111
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,330
but not enough to satisfy that curiosity.

112
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,060
Here are two actual titles
from a news website.

113
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,730
Nine out of 10 Americans
are completely wrong

114
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,200
about this mind blowing fact.

115
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,630
And someone gave some kids some scissors.

116
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,920
Here's what happened next.

117
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,950
I think we can all agree
that these are examples

118
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,453
of bad type II clickbait.

119
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,170
Now, imagine a clickbait
space where on one axis,
不妨想像一个平面，它可以覆盖所有的“标题党”

120
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,630
you have how misleading
or sensationalized it is.
一个维度描述它的误导性或者情绪化程度

121
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,630
And on the other, how much information
另一个维度则表明

122
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,880
is intentionally withheld
to create a curiosity gap.
为了设置悬念，它所隐瞒信息的多少

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,180
Well, then these two titles
fall in the top right corner.
那么，刚才这两个标题就落在右上角

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,740
And these are the zones
of type II clickbait.
这些就是第二类标题党所在的区域

125
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,710
At the other extreme,
而在另一端

126
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,730
you have things that are so
unsensationalized as to be dull.
这些标题是如此平淡，以至于有点枯燥

127
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,550
You could call this the dead zone.
可以把这边称作“盲区”

128
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,727
Now, here is where you would find
再看这里，你可以找到

129
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,650
"Strange applications
of the Magnus Effect."
“马格努斯效应的奇特应用”之类的标题

130
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,750
I mean, I didn't tell you
what the applications were.
也就是说，标题没有点明这些应用是什么

131
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,980
Now, in the middle is where you
would find type I clickbait.
中间则是第一类标题党的所在

132
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,230
But honestly, I think type
I and type II clickbait
但是说真的，这两类标题党的区别

133
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,440
are so different, that
we shouldn't even use
在我看来是很大的

134
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,990
the same word for them.
大到不该用一个词形容

135
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,600
Instead of type I clickbait,
原来用的“第一类标题党”

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
my friend and YouTuber, Brady
Heron suggested legitbait.
我的一位up主朋友，Brady Heron，建议用“守序标题党“来取代它

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,310
I mean, it might sound
enticing, but it is legit.
意思是，它看似在骗点击，但其实是合理的。

138
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,730
Instead of type II clickbait,
与其用“第二类标题党”

139
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,730
we could use clicktrap,
clicktrick, linktrap or dupechute.
我们不如换成“点击陷阱”“点击诡计”
“陷阱链接”“整蛊链接”这些词

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,940
What's important to recognize
is that for any given video,
还要意识到一个重要的事实，就是对于任何视频

141
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,170
there is no one true title and thumbnail.
并没有唯一标准的标题和封面图

142
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,760
Each video could have
hundreds or thousands
每个视频都可以有成百上千

143
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
of different legitbait titles.
各不相同的“合理标题”

144
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,070
For example, how does a zero-G plane work?
比方说，“零重力飞机是如何运转的？”

145
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,440
I went on a plane that does
parabolic trajectories.
我曾乘坐过这种飞机，它沿抛物线飞行

146
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,970
What happens to fire on a zero-G plane?
“零重力飞机上的火焰会发生什么？”

147
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,160
Now, the most enticing
titles and thumbnails
可以发现，最有诱惑力的标题和封面图

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,150
are found close to type II clickbait.
和第二类标题党很接近

149
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,560
I'm reminded of the infographic
by smarter every day,
我想起 SmarterEveryDay 制作的那张图表

150
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,270
showing that on social media,
它表明，在社交媒体上

151
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,620
the greatest engagement
occurs close to the boundary
最有吸引力的话题

152
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,950
of what's allowable.
是在违法的边缘打擦边球

153
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,430
But remember that everyone's
definition of clickbait
但要记住，每个人判断标题党的标准不同

154
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,260
is different, and everyone's perceptions
而且每个人对于

155
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,970
of words and images are different.
文字和图片的理解不同

156
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,850
So these are not clear boundaries.
所以这些分界并不清晰

157
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,200
They're actually kind of fuzzy.
实际上，还有点模糊

158
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,270
What for one person might be legitbait,
某人觉得是“守序标题党”的标题

159
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,240
for someone else, could be a clicktrap.
在另一个人看来，可能就是骗点击的陷阱

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
What's clear is that on a site
显然

161
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,960
where click-through rate is important,
在一个重视点击率的网站

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,270
clickbait of all types is inevitable.
出现各种标题党是难以避免的

163
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,760
How important to a video's success
对一个视频的成功而言

164
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
is the title and thumbnail?
标题和封面有多重要呢

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,430
- Very important. Of course.
当然是非常重要

166
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,263
If they don't click on the video,
如果观众不点进视频

167
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,430
they don't watch it.
他们压根就看不到它

168
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,907
You can't get 10 million views
只有你获得了一千万点击

169
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:48,100
unless 10 million people
click on the video.
才有可能收获一千万的播放量

170
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,930
So, I mean, it's literally that simple.
所以我觉得，它就是这么简单

171
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,630
They don't click on it,
they don't watch it.
观众点进去，才会看到视频

172
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,090
- So, why is clickbait everywhere?
那，为什么到处都是标题党呢

173
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,300
Well, because it works.
因为它效果好

174
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,700
More enticing thumbnails get more clicks.
封面图越诱人，收获的点击数越多

175
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,230
Despite some people's claims
尽管有人声称

176
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,430
that they won't click or they'll unsub,
他们不会手贱点进去，否则就取关

177
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,950
it's just like evolution.
但这依然像生物进化一样

178
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,100
Whatever survives, multiplies
and traits become amplified.
凡是存活下来的都会繁殖，它们的特征也会被放大。

179
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,720
If you don't begrudge
the giraffe its long neck
如果你不嫉妒长颈鹿

180
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,630
so it can reach the highest leaves,
用来够着最高处树叶的脖子

181
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,070
can you begrudge a YouTuber the red arrow
那你会嫉妒up主们

182
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,870
that allows them to
reach further audiences?
用来收割更多关注者的红箭头吗

183
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,000
I talked about this in
my video two years ago.
两年前，我曾在一期视频里谈到过这个

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,540
To be successful as a YouTuber,
想当一个成功的up主

185
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,440
you need to optimize two things,
你要优化两个东西

186
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,140
watch time and the click-through
rate of your videos.
观看时长，以及视频的点击率

187
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,460
That's the number of times
也就是用

188
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,730
the title and thumbnail are clicked,
标题和封面的点击次数

189
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,000
divided by the total number
of times they're shown.
除以它们出现的总次数

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,130
That's the number of impressions.
也就是印象数

191
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,963
Now at the time,
当时

192
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:37,140
this was something of a revelation for me
这个概念让我耳目一新

193
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,910
because I always thought my
job was to make great videos.
因为我一直觉得，我的职责就是制作优质的视频

194
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,210
And then a title and thumbnail
还有一组

195
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,840
that adequately represented
what the video was about.
恰当呈现视频主旨的标题和封面

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,640
But now I've realized that
making the title and thumbnail
但我现在意识到，构思标题和封面

197
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,220
is at least half the job.
至少占了一半的工作量

198
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,570
This is not just because
better titles and thumbnails
这不只是因为

199
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,700
get you more clicks,
更好的标题和封面能带来更多点击数

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,140
but because better titles and thumbnails
还因为它们可以

201
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,160
will get you way more impressions.
给你带来更多出现的机会

202
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,260
YouTube has limited real estate
Youtube 的空间是有限的

203
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,280
with which to show you
virtually infinite content.
在这里，它要给你推送几乎无穷多的内容

204
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,350
And so it's not enough
to make a good video
所以，仅仅做出好视频是不够的

205
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,130
even if people watch all of it,
即使观众会把视频看完

206
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,270
you also have to make
a title and thumbnail
你也要呈现一个标题和封面

207
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,140
that gets clicked,
especially in competition
吸引人们去点击它，尤其是在

208
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,700
with other really good
titles and thumbnails.
和其他相当优秀的标题竞争的时候

209
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,440
That's the only way you can expect YouTube
这是你从 Youtube 那里

210
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,548
to give you more impressions.
获得更多出现机会的唯一方式

211
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:19,280
Now, the big development
since my last video on this
自从我上次做同样话题的视频后，有了一个大进展

212
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,780
is YouTube introduced real-time metrics
就是 Youtube 引进了实时的度量指标

213
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,303
like views, impressions
and click-through rate.
包括观看次数，印象数和点击率等等

214
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,770
Now, I suggested this
would create an arms race.
我觉得，这将会带来一场创作者的军备竞赛

215
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,470
So what you can bet will happen
那么，几乎可以肯定，接下来会发生的是

216
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,680
is that creators will launch a video
创作者们会开始做视频

217
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,690
and then they'll be sitting there
然后他们就会坐在那

218
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,640
with all these different
variants of thumbnails
给视频配各种封面

219
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,380
and they'll be swapping them out
再把它们换来换去

220
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,030
and looking at what that
does to click-through rate
看看这对点击率有什么影响

221
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,740
and then going with the one
接着选定一个

222
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,610
that leads to the greatest
click-through rate.
能带来最多点击量的封面

223
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,210
And this is basically what has happened.
基本上，这就是已经发生的一切

224
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,410
Let me give you my favorite example.
给你举个我最中意的例子

225
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,020
Last year, I made a video about asteroids,
去年，我做了个关于小行星的视频

226
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,710
which I thought was really good.
我觉得它很不错

227
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,930
I called it "Asteroids:
Earth's Biggest Threat,"
我给的标题是：“小行星：地球的最大威胁”

228
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,650
which is something Stephen Hawking said.
这是史蒂芬·霍金说过的话

229
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,930
And people were very
positive about the video.
观众对这个视频的评价很积极

230
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,200
They thought it was maybe one of my best,
他们觉得这也许能成为我的代表作

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,950
but the performance
was well below average.
但是这个视频的表现远低于平均水平

232
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,720
In its first day,
asteroids was ranked ninth
上线的第一天，在我最近十部作品里

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,080
out of my previous 10 videos.
这个视频的指标排在第九位

234
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
It was probably on target
它可以达到的观看数目标

235
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,070
for about one and a half million views.
大约在150万左右

236
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,270
So I tried different titles and thumbnails
于是，我尝试了不同的标题和封面

237
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,130
like, "Asteroid Impact:
What Are Our Chances?"
比如说，“小行星撞地球：我们的机会有多少？”

238
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,820
Or "Asteroid Impact: What Could We Do?"
还有 “小行星撞地球：我们能做什么？”

239
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,850
But none of these changes
got much traction.
但这些改动没有什么吸引力

240
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,520
And then on day three after launch,
然后，在视频发布的第三天，我吃过午饭以后

241
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,010
I changed the title and thumbnail

242
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,650
to "These Are the
Asteroids to Worry About."

243
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,480
And immediately the video
started doing better.

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,980
It quickly shot up from almost
my worst performing video

245
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,720
to my best.

246
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,030
It now has 14 million views.

247
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,790
Nothing about the video changed,

248
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,130
just that one image and 38 characters.

249
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,180
But because of that, the video has reached

250
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,820
nearly 10 times as many people
as it otherwise would have.

251
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,100
And the title and thumbnail
accurately describe

252
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,490
what the video is about.

253
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,700
I mean, sure, there's a curiosity gap,

254
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,740
but you couldn't explain the whole concept

255
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,550
in the length of the title.

256
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,550
So if you see a YouTuber
changing titles and thumbnails,

257
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,070
this is why.

258
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,250
Because that effort can be
rewarded many times over.

259
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,020
I've seen people
objecting to this practice

260
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,380
because they think the creator

261
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,730
is trying to dupe their audience,

262
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,700
get them to click on the
same video more than once,

263
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,780
but that's not it.

264
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,410
The whole point is to get YouTube

265
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,610
to show the title and
thumbnail to more people.

266
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,650
We're trying to increase
the number of impressions,

267
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,630
which is heavily dependent
on the click-through rate.

268
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,470
Now, a lot of my recent videos
have this typical view curve.

269
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,690
There's an initial spike
after I release the video

270
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,020
and then a dip, and then a second bump

271
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,130
after I have figured out a
better title and thumbnail.

272
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,580
I change the title and thumbnail

273
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,150
and I watch the real time view graph.

274
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,480
What I'm looking for is a
noticeable bump in views.

275
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,050
Sometimes there's no change,
sometimes it gets worse,

276
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,720
but on occasions, when you
see something like this,

277
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,520
well then, you know you've found a winner.

278
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,810
This is something all the
big YouTubers are doing.

279
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,430
Not even Mr. Beast knows exactly

280
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,899
which thumbnail will work best beforehand.

281
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,747
Have you ever changed
a title and thumbnail

282
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,580
and then the video did better?

283
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,760
- Oh, of course.

284
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,290
So everybody, I usually make
like two or three thumbnails,

285
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,000
and then if it's not
doing as well as I want,

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,262
we usually just swap 'em out
and see if it does better.

287
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:17,700
'cause the thing is like,
you don't really know.

288
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,190
I mean, you could know if you
just were an almighty being

289
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,800
that could just predict what
people would be interested in,

290
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,280
but you know, usually...

291
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,350
Like, you can do hide and seek.

292
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,810
You don't really know if
like you hiding in a tree

293
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,850
and then someone walking
below you is a good thumbnail.

294
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,350
Or if you hiding a trash can and
them walking in front of you.

295
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,750
So, you know, just do both

296
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,210
and then see which one interests
people a little bit more.

297
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,043
- I feel the same way,

298
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,190
but I do feel like you have a better sense

299
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,080
of this than like most people.

300
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,913
- Of course.

301
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,592
I mean, no one gets 40
million views a video.

302
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,300
(both laughing)

303
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,360
- But what is the point
in getting more views?

304
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,193
If you're cynical,

305
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,810
you might say it's all
about money and fame.

306
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,080
And while there are certainly
financial incentives

307
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,860
to getting more views,
that's not why I do it.

308
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,360
As an educational YouTuber,

309
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,370
I think there are two very good reasons

310
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,840
for using excellent type I clickbait

311
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,110
over more straightforward packaging.

312
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,550
To understand the first reason,

313
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,710
let's consider two
different possible titles

314
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,360
for my most recent video.

315
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,020
I called it "The Simplest Math
Problem No One Can Solve,"

316
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,350
but it's a video about
the Collatz conjecture.

317
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,470
So perhaps a more straightforward title

318
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,810
would have been simply to call it that.

319
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,570
The problem is, if I publish a video

320
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,500
called the Collatz conjecture,

321
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,450
the most likely people to click on it

322
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,647
are those who already know
what the Collatz conjecture is.

323
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,750
And the vast majority of people
will never have heard of it.

324
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,210
So for them, the title is meaningless

325
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,020
and only the very curious

326
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,800
or those who really like
Veritasium would click.

327
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,230
In contrast, calling it
"The Simplest Math Problem

328
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,830
No One Can Solve,"
conveys more information

329
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,800
about the video to everyone.

330
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,780
And this means more
people can click on it,

331
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,280
most of whom will never have heard

332
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
of the Collatz conjecture.

333
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,852
So I get to teach them something new.

334
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,790
And since the video has a
higher click-through rate,

335
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,000
YouTube shows it to even more people.

336
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,110
So if my aim is to increase
the level of knowledge

337
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,940
in the world by the
maximum amount possible,

338
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,660
this is the way to do it.

339
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,050
The second reason we need to
optimize titles and thumbnails

340
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,920
is to support the major
goal of this channel.

341
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,120
We are trying to make
the best science films

342
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
on every topic we tackle.

343
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,480
That means traveling to meet
experts in film experiments,

344
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,410
hiring people to build props,

345
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,420
make spectacular animations,
research and fact check.

346
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,320
We hire expert consultants

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,700
to double and triple check our work.

348
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,110
I don't wanna make vlogs.

349
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,260
I wanna make science
documentaries on YouTube

350
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,220
that put broadcast to shame.

351
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,480
And to make this possible and sustainable,

352
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
the videos have to get
views and lots of them.

353
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,740
And to do that, we have to make

354
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,360
the best titles and thumbnails we can.

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,590
YouTuber and Patreon CEO, Jack Conte

356
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,000
has talked about adjusting your packaging.

357
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,310
The idea is know what
you're passionate about,

358
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,000
what you won't compromise on

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,270
and that stuff goes in the box.

360
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,740
All the rest, like what
paper it's wrapped in,

361
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,190
that's the packaging.

362
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,780
So the video is my focus
and the title and thumbnail

363
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,110
are the packaging that
I'm happy to adjust,

364
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,200
so I can make the type of
videos that are important to me.

365
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,590
Now, is it ironic that a
channel whose whole purpose

366
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,420
is to promote a true seeking mindset

367
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,170
has to experiment at the
edge of what is truthful

368
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,940
in order to fulfill that purpose?

369
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,920
It is something that I
often worry about.

370
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
You know, when I did like
risking my life to do X,

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
it's like, well, what probability of death

372
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,390
does there have to be for
you to risk your life?

373
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,957
Like 50%?

374
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,692
- I love how he always overthinks things.

375
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:33,953
(laughs)
That's funny.

376
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:36,433
He's like, is my life risked enough

377
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,520
where I can put I risked my life?

378
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,250
I only had a 9% chance of dying

379
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,200
and I need at least a 13% chance.

380
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,350
You're so funny.

381
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,950
He was the same way two years ago

382
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,190
when he asked me all this stuff.

383
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,690
I was like, "Dude, just do
whatever makes the most sense.

384
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,390
- Yeah, I mean, obviously
I feel like my instincts

385
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,590
are not good.

386
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,530
But what I realized

387
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,430
is that I don't have
to trust my instincts.

388
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,460
This problem of getting the
best title and thumbnail,

389
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,700
well, it's a scientific problem.

390
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,740
We're just asking which accurate
representation of the video

391
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,610
will get the most clicks
from a general audience.

392
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,730
And that's a problem we can use

393
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,810
the scientific method to solve.

394
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,780
So I've hired a couple
of really bright people

395
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,740
and we spend a lot of time brainstorming

396
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,620
and making titles and
thumbnails and testing them out.

397
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,770
For example, on Twitter and Patreon.

398
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,090
Varitasium titles and
thumbnails have gotten better,

399
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,970
not because I'm better at it,

400
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,530
but because of my team and our testing.

401
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,610
If you have ideas about
how we could do it better,

402
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,270
please get in touch.

403
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,860
The results have often
contradicted what I expected.

404
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,890
I mean, this video seemed
to perform 10% better

405
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,750
when we excluded the word
surprising from the title.

406
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,500
So it became simply The
Secret of Synchronization.

407
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,480
I thought these two titles
were basically a toss up,

408
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,220
but Patreon had a strong
preference for one over the other.

409
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,960
What's interesting about this research

410
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,020
is that the more clickable
titles and thumbnails

411
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,720
often better represent
the content of the video.

412
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,770
Let me give you some examples.

413
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,900
One thing I didn't expect
when YouTube brought in

414
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,420
the real time analytics tools

415
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,930
and allowed title and thumbnail changes

416
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,660
to affect impressions,

417
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,400
was that it would also
work for older videos.

418
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,127
So here is an old video
that I originally entitled,

419
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:15,520
"Why the Neutron is the
Hero of Nuclear Physics."

420
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,840
In hindsight, it's a weird,
kinda meaningless title.

421
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,600
So I changed it to, "Why Einstein Thought

422
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,800
Nuclear Weapons Impossible."

423
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,870
It's clearer, more accurate.

424
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,510
And this is what happened
to views after the change.

425
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,380
I changed "Strange Applications
of the Magnus Effect"

426
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,640
to "Backspin Basketball Flies Off Dam."

427
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,830
Again, more accurate.

428
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,830
And the video is now
being watched on YouTube.

429
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,850
Probably 10 million more views

430
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,720
than it otherwise would have had.

431
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
Even anti-clickbait has proven effective.

432
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,367
Here's a video I originally titled,

433
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,600
"Are Negative Ions Good For You?"

434
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,050
Which is a question nobody asked ever.

435
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,647
Now, I changed it to,
"Do Salt Lamps Work?"

436
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,400
Seriously.

437
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,933
And here's the result:

438
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,940
One and a half million more views.

439
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,620
I think looking at these examples,

440
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,930
you could easily make the case

441
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,980
that YouTube has made
me better at what I do.

442
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,060
It has improved the clarity and accuracy

443
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,320
of my titles and thumbnails.
It's helped me figure out

444
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,670
what is interesting to my audience

445
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,120
and how to encapsulate
that in a single image

446
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,230
and fewer than 50 characters.

447
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,180
For those of you who worry that a focus

448
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,720
on titles and thumbnails will prevent me

449
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,580
from picking challenging science topics,

450
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,010
well, I simply ask you
to look at the videos

451
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,440
from the last year or two,

452
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,580
like the ones on Gödel's
incompleteness theorem,

453
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,560
general relativity, Penrose tilings,

454
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,720
the logistic map, Newton's
method of calculating Pi,

455
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,640
the one way speed of light.

456
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,850
Good titles and thumbnails
make it possible

457
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,610
to tackle these topics
and to reach more people

458
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,790
who have heard of them before.

459
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,630
There is a symbiotic relationship

460
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,160
between views and video quality.

461
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,980
The more views we get, the more people,

462
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,100
locations, props and equipment

463
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,290
and research we can invest in.

464
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,440
This makes the next video
better than the last.

465
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,620
If we can be good at
titles and thumbnails,

466
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,580
the ultimate outcome is better videos.

467
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,213
That is something I think
you and I both want.

468
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,090
Hey, this video is sponsored by KiwiCo,

469
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,120
a long time supporter of the channel.

470
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,760
Now KiwiCo makes awesome
hands on projects for kids,

471
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,400
including big kids like me.

472
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
They have eight subscription lines

473
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,390
targeted at different age groups,

474
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,010
all the way down to newborns.

475
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,390
What I love about KiwiCo crates

476
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,710
is that they make learning fun

477
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,200
and something to look forward to.

478
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,900
I mean, when I pull out a crate,

479
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,470
my kids just jump at the
chance to make it with me.

480
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,270
And all the materials you
need come right in the box.

481
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,970
So there's no need to run to the store.

482
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,940
You just open it up and go.

483
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,520
My kids and I just built
this domino machine,

484
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,870
which, who knows, might be
inspiration for a viral video.

485
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,440
Now, the big idea is that
while playing and having fun,

486
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,810
kids learn about STEAM concepts.

487
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,890
That is science, technology,
engineering, art and math.

488
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,180
And in addition to the project,

489
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,900
there's a magazine with a lot
of additional information.

490
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,890
So I think this is the best way to learn.

491
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,220
By doing something
yourself and having fun,

492
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,200
it's how education should be.

493
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,210
So if you wanna try it out,

494
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,720
go to Kiwico.com/veritasium50,

495
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,610
and you'll get 50% off your
first month of any crate.

496
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,610
I will put that link
down in the description.

497
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,160
So I wanna thank KiwiCo
for sponsoring Veritasium,

498
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,568
and I wanna thank you for watching.
