1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,630
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,060
one that young mathematicians are warned

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,050
not to waste their time on.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,520
It's a simple conjecture

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,700
that not even the world's
best mathematicians

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,330
have been able to solve.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,167
Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said,

8
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:20,107
"Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions."

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,950
Here's how it works.

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,290
Pick a number, any number.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,230
Seven?

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,390
Good choice.

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,640
Okay, we're gonna apply two rules.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,210
If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one.

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,310
So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22.

16
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,390
If the number is even, we divide by two.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,510
So 22 divided by two is 11.

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,220
Now, we keep applying these two rules.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,750
11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,350
Even, divide by two, 17, odd.

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,000
Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,860
Divide by two, 26, still even.

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,760
Divide by two, 13, odd.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,970
So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40,

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,700
which is even, so we divide by two, 20,

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,870
divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd.

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,100
Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16,

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,100
divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one.

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,220
Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one,

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,510
which equals four.

31
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,290
But four goes to two, goes to one,

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,190
so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,280
Now, the conjecture is this:

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,350
every positive integer,
if you apply these rules,

35
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,770
will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop.

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,290
This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture

37
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,470
after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz,

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,930
who may have come up with it in the 1930s.

39
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,310
But the problem has many
origin stories and many names.

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,470
It's also known as the Ulam conjecture,

41
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,790
Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture,

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,270
Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem,

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,620
and simply 3N+1.

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,550
Why is 3x+1 so famous?

45
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,010
- Among professional mathematicians,

46
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,430
maybe it's not famous but infamous,

47
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,130
in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,150
that they're working on it,

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,564
then there's something wrong with them.

50
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:17,330
(laughs)

51
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,010
- [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1

52
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,250
are called hailstone numbers,

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,985
because they go up and down

54
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:26,600
like hailstones in a thundercloud,

55
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,060
but eventually, they all fall down to one,

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,730
or at least we think they do.

57
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,900
You can think of the numbers

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,880
as representing the height
above the ground in meters.

59
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,850
So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground.

60
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,620
And if you apply 3x+1,

61
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,030
it rises up as high as 40 meters.

62
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,310
And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one.

63
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,670
So 10 is called its total stopping time.

64
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,330
But take the very next number, 27,

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,610
and it bounces around all over the place.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,327
In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232.

67
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,430
As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest,

68
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,420
before it too falls back to the ground.

69
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,420
In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,660
and end up in the four, two, one loop.

71
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,830
The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely,

72
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,120
even numbers right next to each other.

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,140
So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem?

74
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,450
Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled.

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,550
- People just decided

76
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,330
that this was something
invented by the Soviets

77
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,600
to slow down U.S. science,

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,230
and it was doing a good job at it

79
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,220
'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,170
and making no progress
on this trivial thing

81
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,080
that you can tell a school of children.

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,210
- [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias

83
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,810
is the world authority on 3x+1.

84
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,440
- The first time I met him
I was a senior in college,

85
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,690
and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this.

86
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,780
Don't work on this problem.

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,940
If you want to have a career,

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,980
do not start spending
time writing about this

89
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,230
or publishing any papers about this.

90
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,370
Do real math for a while
to establish yourself."

91
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,650
- [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen.

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,340
He and Yakov Sinai

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,890
looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers.

94
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,340
Were there any patterns?

95
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,420
But obviously all of them ended up at one.

96
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,740
But what about the paths
they take to get there?

97
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,610
The pattern is randomness.

98
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,010
Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random.

99
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,050
The graph peaks and then drop so low

100
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,720
that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale.

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
But if you take the logarithm,

102
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,020
you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend.

103
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,950
It looks like the stock
market on a bad day.

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,010
And this is no coincidence.

105
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,560
Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion.

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,870
That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend,

107
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,910
the fluctuations are random.

108
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,710
It's like flipping a coin each step.

109
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,030
If the coin is heads, the line goes up,

110
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,070
tails, it goes down.

111
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,910
3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market.

112
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,060
Over long-enough periods,

113
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,320
the stock market tends to trend upwards,

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,883
while 3x+1 trends down.

115
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,470
Another way to analyze 3x+1

116
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,090
is by looking at the
leading digit of each number

117
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,370
in a sequence.

118
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,020
Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three

119
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,410
as the seed.

120
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,720
And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one,

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,270
how many start with a two,

122
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,060
how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram.

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,890
We can do the same thing for the sequence

124
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,990
that starts with four,
and that's a short one,

125
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,990
and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven.

126
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,970
Again, for each sequence,

127
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,620
we're just counting up how many numbers

128
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,860
start with each digit, one through nine,

129
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,780
and adding that to our histogram.

130
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,640
If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers,

131
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,690
eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern.

132
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,070
For the first billion sequences,

133
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,700
you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit.

134
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,200
30% of all numbers start with one,

135
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,030
around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three,

136
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,710
and the frequency decreases
for higher digits.

137
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,670
Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine.

138
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,250
Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1.

139
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,670
It actually comes up everywhere,

140
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,630
from the populations of countries,

141
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,330
to the value of companies,

142
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,300
all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers,

143
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,070
just to name a few.

144
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,200
The distribution is
known as Benford's law,

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,980
and it is even used to detect fraud.

146
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,750
If all the numbers on
your income tax forms

147
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,770
obey Benford's law,

148
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,030
then, well, you're probably being honest.

149
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,720
If not, you may be hiding something.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
In elections, Benford's law can be used

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,070
to spot irregularities,

152
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,420
though you have to apply it correctly.

153
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,030
Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved

154
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,200
span several orders of magnitude

155
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,820
as they do for 3x+1.

156
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,990
But Benford's law can't tell us

157
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,710
whether all numbers will end up

158
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,800
in the four, two, one loop or not.

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,970
For that, we need a
different sort of analysis.

160
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,820
Now, at first glance,

161
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,660
it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1,

162
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,930
all numbers should end up at one.

163
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,570
I mean, consider that
there are the same number

164
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,810
of odd and even numbers,

165
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,330
but odd numbers are more than tripled,

166
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,400
while even numbers are only cut in half.

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
should grow, not shrink.

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,670
But here's the catch.

170
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,760
Every time you multiply
an odd number by three

171
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,760
and then add one, it will
always become an even number,

172
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,000
and that means the next
step is to divide by two.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,550
So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1.

174
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,690
They're increased by a factor
of about three over two.

175
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm neglecting the plus one

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,170
because it's insignificant
for large numbers.

177
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,820
And 3/2 is actually the most

178
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,160
an odd number can grow in one step.

179
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,690
Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence

180
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,430
to the next odd number.

181
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,420
After multiplying by three and adding one,

182
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,290
you have an even number.

183
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,760
And 50% of the time,

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,220
dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number.

185
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,890
But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four

186
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,640
before you get to the next odd number.

187
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,540
So, for a quarter of numbers,

188
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,000
the next one in the sequence

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,210
will be 3/4 of its initial value.

190
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,390
An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight

191
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,140
before getting to the next odd number,

192
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,270
and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on.

193
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,420
If you take the geometric mean,

194
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,640
you find, on average, to
get from one odd number

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,100
to the next one, you
multiply by three over four,

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,920
which is less than one.

197
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,610
So statistically speaking,

198
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,920
3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow.

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,350
Take 341 for example,

200
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,250
multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024,

201
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,340
which you can divide by two

202
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,900
and then divide by two again, and again,

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,420
and again, and again,

204
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,743
10 times in total until
you're down to one.

205
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,060
One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1

206
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,930
is simply to show how each number

207
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,360
connects to the next one in its sequence.

208
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,150
This is called a directed graph.

209
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,430
It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams

210
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,170
that flow into each other.

211
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,740
If the conjecture is true,

212
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,240
it means that every single number

213
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,150
is connected to this graph.

214
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,540
Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity

215
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,540
eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,900
Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization

217
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,560
by rotating the graph at each number;

218
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
anticlockwise if it's an odd number,

219
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,810
and clockwise if it's even.

220
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,110
And then you end up with a structure

221
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,860
that looks like a coral or seaweed.

222
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,930
And by adjusting the degree of rotation

223
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,460
for odd and even numbers,

224
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,543
you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes.

225
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,890
Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false.

226
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,320
There could be a number
somewhere, some seed,

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,260
that starts a sequence of numbers

228
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,850
that grows to infinity.

229
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,260
For whatever reason,

230
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,960
it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity

231
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,710
as all of the other numbers.

232
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,050
Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers

233
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,530
that forms a closed loop.

234
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,000
All the numbers in this loop

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,230
would be unconnected to the main graph.

236
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,910
But thus far, no loop

237
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,530
or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found.

238
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,950
And not for lack of trying,

239
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,570
mathematicians have tested by brute force

240
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,160
every single number up to two to the 68.

241
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,160
That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers.

242
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,650
We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers

243
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,310
eventually comes back down to one.

244
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,640
We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers,

245
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,560
and none of them disproves the conjecture.

246
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,460
In fact, given this information,

247
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,530
mathematicians calculate that any loop

248
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,940
other than four, two, one

249
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,530
must be at least 186 billion numbers long.

250
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,810
So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true,

251
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,950
but this doesn't prove it.

252
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,480
One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it

253
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,720
is by making a scatterplot

254
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,910
with all the seed numbers on the x-axis

255
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,100
and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis.

256
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,890
Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence

257
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,200
there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed,

258
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,950
well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture,

259
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,710
because whatever number you pick,

260
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,290
you know it will at
some point get smaller,

261
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,600
and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller,

262
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,830
and so on down to one,

263
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,700
meaning the only way any sequence can end

264
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,040
is in the four, two, one loop.

265
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,120
This has not yet been shown.

266
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,200
But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show

267
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,920
that almost all Collatz sequences

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,540
reach a point below their initial value.

269
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,890
In 1979, this limit was reduced

270
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,150
with almost all numbers

271
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,370
going to less than X
to the power of 0.869.

272
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,080
And then in 1994,

273
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,260
it was further lowered

274
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,420
to less than X to the power of 0.7925.

275
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,950
In this case, the term almost all numbers

276
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,720
has a technical mathematical definition.

277
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,970
It means that as the
numbers you're looking at

278
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,770
go to infinity,

279
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,533
the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one.

280
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,180
Then in 2019,

281
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,260
one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians,

282
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,810
Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys

283
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,300
even stricter criteria.

284
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,900
He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller

285
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,810
than any arbitrary function f of x

286
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,130
so long as that function goes to infinity

287
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,220
as x goes to infinity.

288
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,500
But the function can rise
as slowly as you like.

289
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500
So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too,

290
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,960
or log, log, log, log x.

291
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,540
What this means is,
for almost all numbers,

292
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,660
you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number

293
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,990
somewhere in its sequence.

294
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,867
In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said,

295
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,810
"This is about as close as one can get

296
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,690
to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it."

297
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,320
This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof.

298
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,440
So why can't we prove the conjecture true?

299
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,010
Could it be because it's not true?

300
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,900
I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true,

301
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,540
which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples.

302
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,970
- It had happened to
me just two years ago,

303
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,700
where there was something
I was trying to prove,

304
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,643
that I was trying for
three years to prove,

305
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,940
and I couldn't get it to work.

306
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,370
And then I found a counterexample,

307
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,070
and then I realized what
the correct statement

308
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,903
should have been.

309
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:55,280
And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement.

310
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,130
Maybe we should be spending more energy

311
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,900
looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending.

312
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,590
- [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27

313
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,410
grows all the way to 9,232?

314
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,030
Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000,

315
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,730
with the largest number
reached for each seed

316
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,770
plotted on the y-axis.

317
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,060
The y-axis stops at a 100,000,

318
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,210
but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale.

319
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,210
The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million.

320
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,710
And as yet, no one has proven

321
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,320
why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity.

322
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,483
And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture,

323
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,260
or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop

324
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,980
not connected to the main graph.

325
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,290
As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one.

326
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,960
But something strange happens

327
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,410
if you include negative numbers.

328
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,950
Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before,

329
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,800
there is not one loop, not two loops,

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,150
but three independent loops of numbers.

331
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,150
And they start at low
values like -17 and -5.

332
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,630
Why should there be disconnected loops

333
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,430
on the negative side of the number line,

334
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,050
but not on the positive side?

335
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,110
Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence

336
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,360
supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof

337
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,910
that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence

338
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,150
that is arbitrarily small.

339
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,870
But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria

340
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,273
isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do.

341
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,940
How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares?

342
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,870
The answer is 10.

343
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,940
So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares.

344
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,840
How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares?

345
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,930
The answer is 31.

346
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,530
So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares.

347
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,690
And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes,

348
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,800
such that in the limit, you could say

349
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,120
almost all numbers are
not perfect squares.

350
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,380
The fraction of numbers

351
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
that are not perfect squares goes to one

352
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,080
as X goes to infinity.

353
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,290
And yet we know

354
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,580
there are an infinite
number of perfect squares

355
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,940
and we know exactly where they are.

356
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,700
Now, we've tested by brute force

357
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,350
all numbers up to two to the 68,

358
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,540
and they all obey the Collatz conjecture.

359
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,670
And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found

360
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,870
a counterexample by this point.

361
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,830
But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing.

362
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,270
I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919

363
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,530
by George Polya

364
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,100
asserted that the majority
of natural numbers

365
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,360
up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors.

366
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,490
The conjecture was eventually proven false

367
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,130
by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958

368
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,610
when he identified a counterexample.

369
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,270
What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample

370
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,010
was 1.845 times 10 to the 361.

371
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,950
That's some 10 to 340 times bigger

372
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,300
than all the numbers checked for 3x+1.

373
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,900
One way to think about 3x+1

374
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,730
is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine.

375
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,220
The seed number is the
input to the machine.

376
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,050
So in this picture, two to the 68

377
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,680
is simply an input tape 68 squares long.

378
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,630
You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros

379
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,950
or black and white squares.

380
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,490
Saying the machine has
transformed every input

381
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,540
up to this 68 square taped down to one

382
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,390
should not give you a lot of confidence

383
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,340
that it will do so for all inputs.

384
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,910
In fact, it's fairly simple

385
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,490
to calculate a number that shows

386
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,880
any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite.

387
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,330
But if you want a number that
increases by three over two

388
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,370
five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number.

389
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,270
If you want a number that
climbs by three over two

390
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,980
10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times,

391
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,530
you can easily calculate those numbers.

392
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,810
But after the finite section you specify,

393
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,460
you have no more control.

394
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,690
And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one.

395
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,300
If there is a counterexample,

396
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,650
it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it.

397
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,470
And the space of all possibilities

398
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,520
is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force.

399
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,180
- Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space.

400
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,320
So, if we're gonna find it,

401
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,150
we have to find it by
some intelligent process

402
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,530
and not by guess and check.

403
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,350
I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years.

404
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,680
And then this point of view,

405
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,853
I realized that, what do we really know?

406
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,750
It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false.

407
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,510
And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling

408
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,700
to prove this thing because
it's not actually true?

409
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,920
And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence.

410
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,450
And even the statistical
version is maybe true

411
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,760
and not evidence for the non-existence

412
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence.

413
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,410
- Of course there is another option,

414
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,620
and that is that we'll never know,

415
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,130
that the problem is undecidable.

416
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,130
In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1.

417
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,470
It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN.

418
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,480
And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete,

419
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,260
which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do,

420
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,440
but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem,

421
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,810
a chance that the machine
never stops running

422
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,630
and so doesn't give you an output.

423
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,070
And this does not prove

424
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,270
that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem,

425
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,670
but it is possible that
given what we know,

426
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,010
we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false.

427
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,360
- You're gonna be taught in school

428
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,500
that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie.

429
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,480
They're all lies.

430
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,680
Here's this stupid little problem.

431
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,870
Come on, really we can't solve this?

432
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,140
Really?

433
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,870
You know, it just shows that math is hard.

434
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,840
If anything, it shows
that all of the things

435
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,010
that we can solve are miracles.

436
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,980
We have no right to have solutions

437
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,740
to all of these other problems.

438
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,190
- For my whole life,

439
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,650
I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things

440
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,780
full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition.

441
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,450
But what I'm realizing only now

442
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,330
is just how peculiar numbers really are.

443
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,440
You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation.

444
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,740
From a simple mathematical operation

445
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,760
comes something intricate,
organic-looking,

446
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,030
and, thus far, intractable to us.

447
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,520
Do all numbers connect to the structure,

448
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,260
or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread,

449
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,040
that doesn't connect to any of this,

450
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,050
that runs off to infinity?

451
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,760
And why is it so hard to tell?

452
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,727
I think that's why Paul Erdos said,

453
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:37,992
"Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions."

454
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:40,659
(gentle music)

455
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,590
What I love about 3x+1

456
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,300
is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand

457
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,690
and play around with.

458
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,920
And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself

459
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,820
is the best way to learn,

460
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,690
which is why I subscribed to Brilliant,

461
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,570
the sponsor of this video.

462
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,780
Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity.

463
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,670
For example, here is a great lesson

464
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,550
on the Pythagorean theorem.

465
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,840
So, you don't just remember the formula,

466
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,430
but you really understand what it means.

467
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,660
Now, Brilliant is a website and an app

468
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,240
designed to get you thinking deeply

469
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,910
by engaging you in problem-solving.

470
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,000
It's one thing to read through a textbook

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,340
and think that you get it,

472
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,480
but it's quite another
to play with interactives

473
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,610
and actually test yourself as you go,

474
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,930
and Brilliant curates the experiences

475
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,890
so they get more and more
challenging over time.

476
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,700
There's always a helpful
tip or explanation

477
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,960
that takes your understanding
to the next level.

478
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,340
I'd highly recommend their course

479
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,220
on mathematical fundamentals,

480
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,900
which now has even more interactivity

481
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,340
and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM

482
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,340
and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding.

483
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,510
It's great to have a resource like this

484
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,860
to inspire you to learn
something new every single day.

485
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,990
I try to start off my day

486
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,180
by challenging myself with Brilliant.

487
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,630
And so if you'd like to join me

488
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,000
and a community of 8
million other learners,

489
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,910
go to brilliant.org/veritasium.

490
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,110
I will put that link
down in the description.

491
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,490
So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video,

492
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,653
and I wanna thank you for watching.
