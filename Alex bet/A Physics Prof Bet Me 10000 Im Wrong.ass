Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.72,English,,0,0,0,,I am here to sign a document betting $10,000
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.72,0:00:07.30,English,,0,0,0,,that my last video is in fact, correct.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.95,0:00:09.69,English,,0,0,0,,This is the video in question.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.28,0:00:11.62,English,,0,0,0,,Some people may have missed it,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.62,0:00:14.91,English,,0,0,0,,but in this car, there is no motor, no batteries,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.91,0:00:17.66,English,,0,0,0,,no energy source, besides the wind itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.14,0:00:24.54,English,,0,0,0,,And the counterintuitive claim, is that this car can maintain speeds faster than the wind that's pushing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.09,0:00:29.89,English,,0,0,0,,There is a physics professor at UCLA, who got in touch,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.89,0:00:31.61,English,,0,0,0,,to say that he thought that I was wrong,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.61,0:00:33.08,English,,0,0,0,,that the explanation was wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.79,0:00:35.32,English,,0,0,0,,You know, we went back and forth a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.32,0:00:36.66,English,,0,0,0,,and eventually I said,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.24,0:00:39.81,English,,0,0,0,,"Well, how about we bet, $10,000?"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.64,0:00:44.62,English,,0,0,0,,"I can prove it to you. This vehicle really can go downwind faster than the wind."
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.41,0:00:48.44,English,,0,0,0,,And to my surprise, he is taking me up on the bet.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.44,0:00:50.01,English,,0,0,0,,- Look, no one is perfect,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.42,0:00:56.50,English,,0,0,0,,but you have a much lower error rate than most people on YouTube, in YouTube Space.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.50,0:01:01.17,English,,0,0,0,,- Now, Professor Alex Kusenko wanted this wager and all related discourse to be public.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.17,0:01:04.45,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, he suggested we get a celebrity to witness the signing.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.45,0:01:08.73,English,,0,0,0,,So I asked Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Sean Carroll to be our witnesses
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.73,0:01:10.48,English,,0,0,0,,And they graciously agreed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.48,0:01:15.40,English,,0,0,0,,- And Alex, I just wanna say, I agree with everything you said about Veritasium.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.40,0:01:21.95,English,,0,0,0,,That generally I can watch it and not have to wonder, is he gonna mess up? How am I gonna-
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.95,0:01:24.59,English,,0,0,0,,- No, he's brilliant, no, he's brilliant.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.59,0:01:28.58,English,,0,0,0,,- I'm excited about this bet, because if I am wrong, then I wanna know.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.58,0:01:31.06,English,,0,0,0,,Like the whole point of the channel is to get to the truth.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.06,0:01:33.63,English,,0,0,0,,And that is, I think why we're all here today.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.63,0:01:36.30,English,,0,0,0,,And I think, you know, this is a great chance to sort of see.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.30,0:01:39.46,English,,0,0,0,,I'm going to summarize Alex's main points in this video,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.46,0:01:41.98,English,,0,0,0,,but I'll put his full presentation here.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.98,0:01:45.89,English,,0,0,0,,- So let me first explain what I see in the video.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.89,0:01:50.70,English,,0,0,0,,In the video, the vehicle is operated in a gusty wind.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.70,0:01:54.82,English,,0,0,0,,Initially, you have the wind speed exceeding the car speed,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.37,0:01:57.05,English,,0,0,0,,but then the wind speed is not constant.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.05,0:01:58.28,English,,0,0,0,,The wind speed drops,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.76,0:02:03.48,English,,0,0,0,,and the car moves by inertia with deceleration for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.48,0:02:07.23,English,,0,0,0,,- So, basically Alex thinks a gust pushes the car to a high speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.23,0:02:12.94,English,,0,0,0,,And then when the wind dies, the car is going faster than the wind momentarily, but it must be slowing down.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.45,0:02:16.24,English,,0,0,0,,- In fact, that will be my conclusion at the end of this presentation,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.24,0:02:20.61,English,,0,0,0,,that whenever you have velocity faster than the wind, I'll actually show you in an equation,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.61,0:02:22.14,English,,0,0,0,,the acceleration is negative.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.81,0:02:26.54,English,,0,0,0,,The second effect is that the wind in the video
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.54,0:02:29.96,English,,0,0,0,,is measured at the height of about a meter or a meter and a half.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.96,0:02:33.13,English,,0,0,0,,But the propeller goes to some three meters above the ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.13,0:02:36.99,English,,0,0,0,,- Now, due to interactions with the ground, there is a wind gradient.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.99,0:02:40.83,English,,0,0,0,,Wind travels slower, close to the ground, and then faster, higher up.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.26,0:02:46.83,English,,0,0,0,,Now, Alex estimated that the wind speed of the propeller might be 10 or 15% higher than at the tell-tale.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.10,0:02:51.45,English,,0,0,0,,So it's possible that the car could be moving slower than the wind at the propeller,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.45,0:02:55.39,English,,0,0,0,,and yet appear to be moving faster than the wind at the height of the tell-tale.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.39,0:02:57.86,English,,0,0,0,,- Now, I think that this is a small effect.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.86,0:03:03.12,English,,0,0,0,,However, in combination with the previous effect, it just can make this more frequent, okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.12,0:03:03.92,English,,0,0,0,,And that completes-
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.93,0:03:07.17,English,,0,0,0,,- Alex, if I remember the video correctly,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.70,0:03:12.83,English,,0,0,0,,Derek reports that they've achieved up to 2.8 times wind speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.83,0:03:17.30,English,,0,0,0,,That feels much higher than what is possible here,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.30,0:03:21.80,English,,0,0,0,,unless the wind had picked up and then spontaneously sort of dropped.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.80,0:03:22.88,English,,0,0,0,,- Very, very good question.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.88,0:03:24.38,English,,0,0,0,,Okay, if you're going for the record,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.31,0:03:27.55,English,,0,0,0,,you probably will do many attempts.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.94,0:03:33.40,English,,0,0,0,,You will be sampling that gusty wind over, and over, and over, until you set the record, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.40,0:03:34.37,English,,0,0,0,,That's how you set the record.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.92,0:03:39.36,English,,0,0,0,,And on one of those occasions, you will get a nice strong gust,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.36,0:03:42.96,English,,0,0,0,,which is three times the air that comes after it, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.96,0:03:48.69,English,,0,0,0,,And that's when you will clock the record. And that's where that 2.8 factor will come in.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.69,0:03:53.06,English,,0,0,0,,- So what about the treadmill tests? These are conducted in still air.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.53,0:03:58.28,English,,0,0,0,,By moving the ground backwards, you're simulating a perfectly steady tailwind.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.72,0:04:01.76,English,,0,0,0,,And if you hold the car stationary on the treadmill,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.76,0:04:04.86,English,,0,0,0,,well, that's equivalent to the car going exactly wind speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.55,0:04:08.57,English,,0,0,0,,Now, if the car can move forward on the treadmill,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.57,0:04:12.20,English,,0,0,0,,that shows it can accelerate faster than the wind.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.06,0:04:18.98,English,,0,0,0,,But Alex had multiple explanations, why these experiments don't actually show what they claim to show.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.98,0:04:24.50,English,,0,0,0,,- If you have this fluctuating speed of the treadmill,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.50,0:04:26.93,English,,0,0,0,,and then if a human just sort of steers it,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.93,0:04:31.87,English,,0,0,0,,it then can introduce unconsciously, a bias towards the desired result.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.87,0:04:35.40,English,,0,0,0,,- So, would it any be that the guy with the spork
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.40,0:04:40.83,English,,0,0,0,,is inducing the model craft to go across the lane now and then?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.83,0:04:45.18,English,,0,0,0,,And as you pointed out, it would go downhill now and then.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.18,0:04:48.20,English,,0,0,0,,- Yeah, I'm sure, I'ma hundred percent sure that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.75,0:04:52.77,English,,0,0,0,,the guy in the video doesn't do it on purpose, okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.05,0:04:53.54,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.68,0:04:57.63,English,,0,0,0,,However, you know, if he is expecting forward drift-
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.63,0:04:58.99,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah no it's classic
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.99,0:05:02.41,English,,0,0,0,,- Yeah, yeah absolutely, that's exactly, okay, so you got it
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.84,0:05:05.82,English,,0,0,0,,- In the absence of convincing experimental evidence,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.82,0:05:08.20,English,,0,0,0,,Alex turned to theoretical analyses,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.20,0:05:11.17,English,,0,0,0,,like one by MIT Aero Professor, Mark Drela.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.49,0:05:14.17,English,,0,0,0,,But here too, he found problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.17,0:05:16.60,English,,0,0,0,,His main concern is that the equation for net force
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.60,0:05:21.87,English,,0,0,0,,includes the difference between the speeds of the car and the wind in the denominator.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.87,0:05:25.48,English,,0,0,0,,Which seems to imply that when traveling exactly wind speed,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.48,0:05:27.52,English,,0,0,0,,you should get infinite force.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.52,0:05:28.98,English,,0,0,0,,- Now, here's the real danger.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.40,0:05:32.59,English,,0,0,0,,Because if Derek drives very close to the wind,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.24,0:05:36.45,English,,0,0,0,,that difference in speed goes to zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.45,0:05:39.20,English,,0,0,0,,If it's one millionth of one percent,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.20,0:05:41.56,English,,0,0,0,,that's like a nuclear bomb exploding behind him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.56,0:05:43.60,English,,0,0,0,,Then Derek is definitely in trouble, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.60,0:05:46.91,English,,0,0,0,,So we need to find something to save Derek's life here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.91,0:05:48.35,English,,0,0,0,,This is serious, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.35,0:05:52.18,English,,0,0,0,,- But dividing by zero, come on, you guys. I never looked at that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.60,0:05:54.68,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] Alex performed his own analysis,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.68,0:05:57.38,English,,0,0,0,,and found no such divide by zero problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.69,0:06:02.99,English,,0,0,0,,In fact, he found there's no way for the car to accelerate at, or above wind speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.99,0:06:05.74,English,,0,0,0,,- The acceleration of this craft is negative.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.45,0:06:10.35,English,,0,0,0,,So when we, you know, so it's possible to move the craft faster than the wind,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.35,0:06:16.00,English,,0,0,0,,but it's not possible to move it at zero acceleration which would be needed to maintain constant speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.65,0:06:18.38,English,,0,0,0,,- [Derek] That is basically where we left it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.38,0:06:19.18,English,,0,0,0,,- I got to run
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.18,0:06:21.18,English,,0,0,0,,- Okay, thank you, thank you, Neil. Thank you very much.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.18,0:06:22.74,English,,0,0,0,,- Thanks guys, thanks Neil.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.74,0:06:28.58,English,,0,0,0,,- So now it was up to me to convince Professor Kusenko that Blackbird really can go faster than the wind,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.14,0:06:31.61,English,,0,0,0,,but his presentation was effective.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.61,0:06:33.89,English,,0,0,0,,After the meeting, Bill Nye emailed me to say,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.28,0:06:39.13,English,,0,0,0,,"I'm pretty sure that the inventors of Blackbird are fooling themselves, or us, or both.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.63,0:06:42.52,English,,0,0,0,,"And I was not thinking critically when I watched your video.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.05,0:06:48.17,English,,0,0,0,,"If this scheme worked, every sailor in the world would be, pun very much intended, on board."
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.22,0:06:50.91,English,,0,0,0,,When I posted about it on Twitter,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.91,0:06:53.54,English,,0,0,0,,Alice Zhang, who runs Chinese Veritasium, said,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.93,0:06:55.12,English,,0,0,0,,"I think you lost Derek.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.12,0:06:57.20,English,,0,0,0,,I'm 80% on Alex's side now."
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.80,0:07:02.88,English,,0,0,0,,What's amazing to me, is that neither one of them had seen my attempts to replicate the treadmill experiments.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.88,0:07:08.44,English,,0,0,0,,For the first video, I asked my friend and YouTube maker, Xyla Foxlin, to make a model downwind cart.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.50,0:07:12.64,English,,0,0,0,,- Oh, no!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.64,0:07:14.81,English,,0,0,0,,- Version one ended in failure,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.81,0:07:18.92,English,,0,0,0,,but Xyla was undeterred, coming back in a couple of days with version two.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.26,0:07:20.65,English,,0,0,0,,- Is it feeling like it's gonna...?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.25,0:07:24.35,English,,0,0,0,,- Unlike these models, most of her projects actually work.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.35,0:07:25.94,English,,0,0,0,,She is determined.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.94,0:07:31.78,English,,0,0,0,,So maybe this tells us something about whether you can actually go faster than the wind, downwind.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.27,0:07:37.84,English,,0,0,0,,What was clear to me is that I didn't do a good enough job in the first video explaining how Blackbird works
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.84,0:07:43.13,English,,0,0,0,,and providing convincing evidence that it can really go faster than the wind in a sustained way.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.13,0:07:46.41,English,,0,0,0,,In my defense, I thought the concept was well enough established.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.78,0:07:51.62,English,,0,0,0,,Way back in 1969, Andrew Bauer built the first successful downwind cart.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.98,0:07:56.85,English,,0,0,0,,And he did it to settle a friendly wager with Aero Engineer, Apolo Smith.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.36,0:08:01.48,English,,0,0,0,,The bet was inspired by a claim in a students paper from 20 years earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.74,0:08:06.68,English,,0,0,0,,Now, Rick Cavallaro, the builder of Blackbird was completely unaware of all this until after he built his cart.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.14,0:08:11.61,English,,0,0,0,,But other analysis have been published under names like the push-me pull-you boat.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.13,0:08:16.11,English,,0,0,0,,So I didn't honestly think anyone would doubt the vehicle's operation,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.11,0:08:18.12,English,,0,0,0,,much less bet me $10,000.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.50,0:08:21.61,English,,0,0,0,,But clearly, there is a need for a deeper explanation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.61,0:08:25.08,English,,0,0,0,,So I want to do that now by responding to the points Alex raised.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.34,0:08:27.70,English,,0,0,0,,So first, let's deal with wind gradient.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.70,0:08:30.41,English,,0,0,0,,I mean, why didn't we measure the speed of the wind higher up?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.77,0:08:33.50,English,,0,0,0,,Well, the answer is because it's already been done.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.77,0:08:38.34,English,,0,0,0,,They mounted tell-tales on fishing poles out to the sides of the propeller and even above it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.82,0:08:41.80,English,,0,0,0,,Now, although the lowest tell-tale flips back first,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.80,0:08:44.68,English,,0,0,0,,all of the tell-tales do eventually flip backwards
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.68,0:08:48.44,English,,0,0,0,,showing that every part of the vehicle is going faster than the wind.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.13,0:08:54.74,English,,0,0,0,,Could this be because of a big wind gust that pushed the car up to high speed and then the wind died?

Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.21,0:10:42.65,English,,0,0,0,,The first thing to know, is that the propeller doesn't work like most people think.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.93,0:11:00.61,English,,0,0,0,,So at wind speed, the car can keep accelerating
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.61,0:11:03.73,English,,0,0,0,,because the wheels turn the fan, which blows air back,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.73,0:11:05.36,English,,0,0,0,,generating forward thrust.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.96,0:11:10.80,English,,0,0,0,,Now the big question is, to drive the fan, there must be a backwards force on the wheels,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.80,0:11:12.41,English,,0,0,0,,which tends to slow them down.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.73,0:11:16.96,English,,0,0,0,,So why isn't this force bigger than the thrust from the propeller
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.96,0:11:18.90,English,,0,0,0,,causing the car to slow down overall?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.45,0:11:25.94,English,,0,0,0,,Well, the answer is, the wheels are going so much faster over the ground than the propeller is moving through the air.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.94,0:11:28.17,English,,0,0,0,,So the thrust force can actually be larger.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.49,0:11:31.92,English,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna do an analysis in the frame of reference of the car.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.92,0:11:36.32,English,,0,0,0,,And the important equation to know is, power equals force times velocity.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.32,0:11:41.66,English,,0,0,0,,So at the wheels, power is input into the system by the ground moving underneath the car.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.18,0:11:53.01,English,,0,0,0,,At the propeller, work is done on the air, as the propeller pushes it backwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.01,0:12:00.08,English,,0,0,0,,The power out equals the force of the prop on the air, times (the speed of the car, minus the speed of the wind).
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.08,0:12:03.58,English,,0,0,0,,The prop is going slower through the air due to the tailwind.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.97,0:12:09.54,English,,0,0,0,,And if we assume no losses, then the power in at the wheels, equals the power out at the propeller.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.54,0:12:15.12,English,,0,0,0,,From this equation, we can see that the force at the propeller will be greater than the force at the wheels.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:15.78,0:12:18.00,English,,0,0,0,,And since the propeller is pushing air back,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.28,0:12:22.49,English,,0,0,0,,the air applies an equal and opposite force forward on the prop.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.89,0:12:27.44,English,,0,0,0,,This is the thrust force, which will be greater than the backwards force on the wheels.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.60,0:12:33.48,English,,0,0,0,,So, this car works like a lever or a pulley
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.48,0:12:37.32,English,,0,0,0,,by applying a small force to the wheels over a larger distance,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.32,0:12:41.90,English,,0,0,0,,the propeller can apply a larger force over a smaller distance.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:41.90,0:12:44.93,English,,0,0,0,,This is just like when you're riding a bike going up hill,

Dialogue: 0,0:12:47.73,0:12:51.52,English,,0,0,0,,to make the wheels move slower over the ground, but with a bigger force.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.72,0:12:57.16,English,,0,0,0,,But now we've run into the divide by zero problem that Professor Kusenko warned us about.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.61,0:13:00.72,English,,0,0,0,,When the speed of the car is exactly equal to the speed of the wind,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.72,0:13:03.90,English,,0,0,0,,it seems like the propeller can provide infinite force.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.84,0:13:11.53,English,,0,0,0,,The answer is no, for two reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.53,0:13:16.30,English,,0,0,0,,First of all, this is exactly what you'd expect theoretically, with any lever or pulley.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.30,0:13:18.24,English,,0,0,0,,If one arm of the lever is zero,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.24,0:13:22.96,English,,0,0,0,,then you can lift an infinite weight with any amount of force on the other side.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.96,0:13:25.76,English,,0,0,0,,The catch is, it's displacement will be zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.44,0:13:30.09,English,,0,0,0,,But second of all, in practice, there is a propeller efficiency term
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.09,0:13:33.33,English,,0,0,0,,that is ill-defined when the propeller is not moving through the air
Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.33,0:13:38.68,English,,0,0,0,,- There's a better formula for the prop proficiency, which is well-defined in the zero speed limit.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:42.72,0:13:45.37,English,,0,0,0,,- And then the divide by zero problem is eliminated.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.25,0:13:50.30,English,,0,0,0,,But that equation makes the problem look more complicated than it actually is.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.69,0:13:57.70,English,,0,0,0,,Here, I have a little cart with a big wheel that rolls on two smaller spools.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:58.14,0:14:04.18,English,,0,0,0,,And what I'm gonna show is that when you have two media moving relative to one another,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.18,0:14:07.56,English,,0,0,0,,well then if this car is in contact with both media,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:07.56,0:14:11.60,English,,0,0,0,,it can actually move faster than their relative velocity.
